You know what I do is write for kids, and in fact, I'm probably the author for kids, more read in the U.S.
And I always tell people I don't want to seem like a scientist.
I can do it as a farmer, or with clothing or clothing and never nobody has chosen a farmer.
I'm here today to talk to you about circles and <unk>
And you know that a <unk> is usually something that fell in some place.
You just have to turn on the apple to see it as a <unk>
That's the painting of a circle.
A friend of mine did that -- Richard <unk>
It's the kind of a complicated circle of which I'm going to talk to you.
My circle began in the middle school, in the middle school, in <unk> Ohio where I was the rare of the class.
When we were going to bleed every week in the bathroom, and a teacher saved me the life.
She saved my life by letting me go into the bathroom of the teachers.
I was doing it to secret it.
For three years.
I had to go from the city.
I had a thumb, 85 dollars, and I ended up in San Francisco, California -- I found a lover -- and in the years, I felt the need to start working in organizations that were fighting AIDS.
About three or four years ago, I got a phone call from that <unk> <unk> lady who said, "I need to see you.
I'm <unk> that of adults never get to know us.
Could you be <unk> to Ohio and please bring that man to that man who has ever found.
And I have to tell you that I have <unk> cancer, and I'd like you to stand up with this please."
Well, the next day we were in <unk>
And we went to see it, and we found ourselves <unk> and we realized that she needed to be <unk>
We found a place, the <unk> and <unk> and <unk> of his family, because it was necessary,
It's something we knew how to do.
And as the woman who wanted to <unk> as an adult came to <unk> it became a <unk> and it was put in my hands.
And what happened was that the circle was closed, it had become a circle -- and that epiphany that I told you about it was done in itself.
<unk> is that death is part of life.
She saved my life, my partner and I save the one of it.
And you know that that part of life needs everything the rest of life.
It needs truth and beauty, and I'm very happy that I talked a lot about this.
It also needs -- needs no dignity, love and pleasure. And it's our work to provide those things.
Thank you.
As an artist, the connection is very important to me.
Through my work, I'm trying to express that humans are not separated from nature, and that everything is interconnected.
I was for the first time Antarctica almost 10 years ago, and I saw my first <unk>
I was <unk>
My heart can quickly, I was <unk> trying to understand what was in front of me.
I put them up to my around <unk> of the water almost 60 feet -- and I couldn't think it was about a <unk> on another <unk> year after year.
<unk> are born when they fall out of the glaciers or break off the ice.
Each iceberg has their own individual personality.
They have a different way of interacting with their environment and their experiences.
Some people refuse to give and hold up to the end, whereas others can't get more and <unk> in a <unk> of passionate <unk>
It's easy to think, when you see a <unk> who are isolated from and all of them in large as we see us sometimes as a human.
But the reality is the opposite.
As it melts a <unk> I'm breathing your atmosphere <unk>
As it melts an iceberg, <unk> fresh water in minerals that feeds in many forms of life.
I come up to photograph these <unk> as if it was the portraits of my ancestors, knowing that in these only moments there are only in that way and won't be going to exist in that way.
It's not death when it's <unk> it's not an end, but a continuation of its way through the cycle of life.
Part of the <unk> ice that photograph is very <unk> it's a couple thousand years old.
And another part of the ice has over 100 thousand years.
The last few pictures that I'd like to show you is a iceberg that I photographed in <unk> Greenland.
It's very often going to be able to witness a <unk> revolution.
Here it is.
You can see the left one little boat.
It's about five meters.
And I'd like you to pay attention to the shape of the iceberg and your line of <unk>
You can see here, <unk> the ship has moved to the other side and the man is standing there.
This is an Greenland, <unk>
<unk> from water about 120 feet or 40 feet.
This video is in real time.
And so we <unk> the iceberg a side of their personality.
Thank you.
I want you to imagine two couples in 1979, the same day, exactly at the same time, every single one of a baby -- OK.
So, two couples each with a baby.
I don't want you to get too much in the details of conception, because if you stop thinking about the conception of conception of itself, I'm not going to pay attention.
Let's think about that for a moment.
And on this stage, I want you to imagine that, in one case, the chromosome and the sperm is joins into the X X chromosome.
And in the other case, the X chromosome of sperm joins up to the X X chromosome.
Both of them <unk> and start life.
We'll go back to talk about them later.
In my activity that I get two <unk>
In one of my <unk> work with the history of anatomy.
I'm a <unk> by training and what I study in this case is the way people are dealing with anatomy -- and human bodies and <unk> how they have considered body fluid -- the idea of <unk> what have you thought about the body.
The other role that performance in my work is the one of an activist, as a <unk> of patients, or, as I say sometimes, <unk> <unk> -- people who are medical patients.
In this case, I've worked with people whose physical characteristics challenge social norms.
I've been working on, for example, with identical twins two people inside one body.
I've worked with people with <unk> people much longer than the average.
And I've worked with many cases of people with <unk> sex -- individuals whose physics of physics doesn't fit into male and conventional female <unk>
In general, we can <unk> <unk>
<unk> takes a lot of ways.
I'm going to give you a few examples of ways of having a sex that doesn't happen in the common or male forms or female.
For example, there's the case of the individual with <unk> <unk> whose <unk> gene in the chromosome and tells the <unk> that we all have in the <unk> life that we all have in <unk> life.
And then, in the lifetime, the testicles produced testosterone.
But given that this individual lacks receptors the body doesn't react to the same.
It's the <unk> <unk>
So, there are high testosterone levels but no reaction.
As a consequence, the body develops on a <unk> course on a <unk> course.
When you get the baby out, the baby looks like a child.
It's a little girl. It's a young girl.
And often, it's not until puberty, when it's growing up and developing the breast but it doesn't have the menstrual period, when someone realizes that something is going on.
After doing tests they realize instead of having <unk> and <unk> actually has testicles and <unk>
The important thing to understand is that you might think this is a man, but it's actually not like that.
Women like men, we have in the body something called <unk>
They're in the back of the body.
<unk> glands produce <unk> the hormone <unk>
Most women like me -- I consider a <unk> woman who doesn't know his <unk> structure, I believe being a typical woman, most women like me are sensitive to the <unk>
We produce <unk> and we respond to the <unk>
As a consequence, someone like me has the most exposed brain to the <unk> that the woman who was born with testicles that have <unk> syndrome.
So sex is a complicated thing, it's not that <unk> are in the middle of the <unk> in some ways you can be everywhere.
Another example: A few years ago, I got a call from a 19 years old, born and raised as <unk> had girlfriend, and sexual relationships with her, he was wearing a life as a kid and had just found that he had <unk> and <unk>
He had an extreme way of a disease called <unk> <unk> <unk>
I had the 20th of the 20th century, and the <unk> glands were so active that, in essence, creating a male hormone environment.
As a consequence, the genitalia was <unk> his brain was exposed to the hormone component typically a male.
He was born with <unk> nobody <unk> nothing.
And it was the 19 years when he started having medical problems with the internal <unk> when doctors figured out that, in fact, was a woman in it.
Well, another quick example of a case of <unk>
Some people with 20th 20th people develop what is known as <unk> -- that they have <unk> tissue wrapped up in <unk> tissue.
We don't know why that is.
So, there's a lot of sex.
The reason that children with this type of bodies will have to be <unk> <unk> twins or <unk> <unk> to <unk> surgeries -- not to be able to have a better physical health.
In many cases, people are perfectly healthy.
The reason that we went to various surgeries is that they are a threat to our social categories.
The system is normally based on the idea that a particular anatomy brings up a particular identity.
We have the idea that being woman is to have <unk> identity, which is black to say to have African anatomy in terms of historical terms.
A very simplistic idea.
And when you present us a body that shows something quite different, we have problems with <unk>
So we have very <unk> ideas in our culture about <unk>
Our nation is based on a concept of the <unk> very romantic.
Imagine how amazing it is to have children who are born like two people inside a body.
The most high case is last year with <unk> African <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> his sex in the <unk> <unk>
A lot of reporters called them to wonder: "What are you going to do in order to determine whether <unk> <unk> is a man or <unk>
And I had to explain to the journalists that don't exist as you test.
In fact, now we know that sex is so complicated that we have to admit that nature doesn't trace a <unk> line between men and women or between men and <unk> and women and <unk> are us who draw that line.
So what we have is a situation where the more we do more and more we have to admit that these categories were to be able to admit that these categories were previously <unk> directly from <unk> categories -- are just a lot more <unk> than they <unk>
And not just in terms of sex.
Also in terms of race, something that happens much more complicated than the terminology <unk>
As we see, we get into a <unk> area.
<unk> for example, the fact that we share at least 95 percent of the DNA with the chimpanzees.
What about the fact of <unk> in just a few <unk>
And as we go into science we get more and more in a uncomfortable area where we have to recognize that the <unk> categories that are probably probably too <unk>
And we're looking at this in all sorts of human life.
One of them, for example, in our current culture, in the United States today, are the struggles in the beginning and the end of life.
It's hard to set up a moment from which a body becomes human and has different rights to the <unk>
There are very <unk> discussions today -- not in public, but within the <unk> about when someone is considered dead.
Our ancestors never had to be able to get it to this question of whether someone was dead.
As a lot of his nose got a pen in front of the nose, and if he moved on, I didn't get it.
If you stopped moving the <unk>
But today, we can, for example, extract vital organs from a body and put them into another body.
And as a consequence, we need to deal with the dilemma to actually determine the death of somebody, and this puts us in a difficult situation where we don't have the simple categories of the past.
And maybe think about this categories of categories could be happy to someone like me.
In politics I'm progressive, <unk> people with unusual bodies, but I have to admit that it makes me nervous.
And so I think that these categories are much more fragile than we thought about <unk>
It would be from the point of view of democracy.
And to tell you about this tension first -- I have to admit that I'm a fervent one of the Taliban <unk>
I know they were <unk> I know they were <unk> but they were big.
I mean, they were so brave and audacious and so radical in what they did, that I find myself every single way to see that <unk> music, <unk> and not for the music, which is totally <unk>
That's why it happened in <unk> with the Taliban <unk>
Parents were <unk> to me, the first activists of the anatomy and wondering why.
What they did -- was a <unk> concept and <unk> it with another that was radical and beautiful and stayed for 200 years.
And as all of you remember, what our parents are, the idea of <unk> the monarchy was based on a very simplistic concept of anatomy.
Now, the monarchs of the old world didn't know the DNA, but they had a clear idea of the right line.
They had the concept of blue blood.
They were from the idea that it came to the political power for the <unk> of the <unk> of the father to the father and then the son, etc.
The Taliban were rejected by the idea and replaced it by a new concept, and that concept was that all men are created the same.
They <unk> the game field and decided that the anatomy that mattered was the common anatomy of common and not the <unk> differences -- that was really radical.
And they were part of it, because they were part of a <unk> system where two things were <unk>
It was <unk> democracy and at the same time <unk> science.
And there's very clear, if you look at the history of the Taliban <unk> that many were very interested in science and in the idea of a <unk> world.
They were <unk> from the <unk> explanations and therefore <unk> the concept of power to be transmitted by a vague idea of birth.
They were moving towards a <unk> concept.
And if you look at it, for example, the Declaration of Independence and talk about nature and the god of nature.
They don't talk about God and the nature of God.
They talk about the power of nature to tell us who we are.
And it was a consequence of the idea of <unk> <unk>
And in doing so, they were <unk> the foundations of the future rights movement movement.
They didn't think of it, but they did it for us and it was great.
And what happened next?
And the women are <unk>
Then the success of the Civil Rights movement came with people from <unk> <unk> who said, "I'm not a <unk>
We found men in the lines of the Civil Rights movement saying, "I'm a man."
And again, people in color that are <unk> to the <unk> coincidence of the <unk> and again, <unk>
We see the same with the <unk> movement.
The problem is, of course, as we look at the <unk> we need to start asking why we keep certain <unk>
But attention, I want to keep some <unk> in our culture.
For example: I don't want to give you a fish the same rights as a human.
I don't want to say that we should be <unk> before anatomy.
I don't want to say that at five years of five years, they should have to have sex with sex or getting married.
There's some <unk> <unk> that for me to make sense that I should be <unk>
But the challenge is to try to figure out what they are, why keep them and make sense.
Well, let's go back to those two things that were going to be at the beginning of this talk.
We have two <unk> both <unk> in the middle of 1979 exactly the same day.
Imagine that one of these, Mary, were born three months before time: June 1, June 1, June 1, June 1, June 1, June 1, June 1, June 1, June 1, June 1, June 1, June 1, June 1, June 1, June 1, June 1, June 1, June 1, June 1, June 1, June 1, June 1, June 1, June 1, June 1, June 1, June 1, June 1, June 1,
Henry, Henry, in the other hand, was born in March in 1980.
For the only fact that I was born three months before Mary gets attributed to all the rights three months before Henry -- the right to Henry -- the right consent to vote, the right to <unk>
Henry has to wait for all of that because it has a biological age, but because it was born.
We found other <unk> in relation to their rights.
Henry, by virtue of being considered man -- if I don't tell you if it's <unk> in virtue of being considered man now is <unk> from the needless <unk> that Mary doesn't have to worry about.
Mary, for their part, it doesn't have the same rights to same-sex marriage, for example.
Henry can marry all states with a woman, but Mary can marry a woman in some states.
So we still have <unk> categories that in various ways are <unk> and questionable.
And now the question is, what do we do now that science went so much in the field of the anatomy that we get to the point of having to admit that a democracy based on anatomy could <unk>
I don't want to give up the science, but at the same time, sometimes I feel like science is going on.
Where do we go here?
It seems like what happens in our culture is kind of a <unk> attitude attitude -- "Well, we have to map the line somewhere, so we're going to do."
But a lot of people are caught in a strange position.
For example, Texas has decided to marry a man with a man who doesn't have to have chromosome and that to marry a woman -- you have to have a <unk>
Now, in practice they don't do tests to people.
But this is also very strange given the story that I told you at the beginning of <unk> <unk> to the <unk>
If you look at one of the founding fathers of modern democracy, Dr. Martin Luther King, in his "I love <unk> <unk> a solution.
It says that we should judge people <unk> not in the color of their skin, but in the content of their <unk> going beyond anatomy.
And I want to say, "Yes, the idea seems like <unk>
But in practice, how do you do that?
How do you judge people based on the content of their <unk>
I want to point out that I'm not sure I'm not sure that we should be able to focus on this for human rights to people, because I have to admit that I know some <unk> <unk> that probably deserve more social services than some humans I know.
I also want to say that maybe some <unk> I know can make more intelligent and smart decisions, about their sexual relationships that I know.
So how do you put the subject of content in <unk>
It turns out.
And one part of me is wondering what would happen if the character of a person could in the future be measured with an instrument, maybe with an MRI <unk>
We want to really want to get to that point?
I'm not sure where we go.
What I know is that it seems to be very important that the United States will still lead this current thinking to the subject of democracy.
We've done a good job in defense of democracy and I think we're going to do a good job in the future.
We don't live, for example, in a context like Iranian in which a man who feels attracted to other men is susceptible to <unk> unless they are willing to be <unk> unless they are willing to engage a sex change in which case it allows you to live.
We're not in that situation.
I'm glad to say that we don't have a context like a surgeon that I talked about a couple years ago that had made light <unk> <unk> to then pick them up and then <unk> their fame.
But when the phone asked her to the operation, I was a very <unk> operation, he said that in that other country these children would be very <unk> and therefore I had to do it.
I said, "Well, it's considered political seekers instead of <unk>
The United States offers tremendous possibilities to people who are not <unk> to change by the entire state.
So I think we need to be on your head.
Well, to conclude, I want to say I've been talking a lot about <unk>
And I want to think about how the democracy would be a democracy, or as it could have been, if we had given greater involvement in the <unk>
And I want to say something a bit radical for a feminist, and that is that I think there may be different ideas from different <unk> <unk> in particular if there are people thinking about a group.
Since years ago, since I've been interested in the <unk> I've also been interested in investigating the sexual difference.
And one of the things that I've been interested in is the differences between men and women in terms of thinking and operate in the world.
And what we know about <unk> studies is that women, on average, not all, but in <unk> they tend to pay more attention to complex social relationships and to deal with those who are <unk> within the group.
And if we think about that, we have an interesting situation in our hands.
So years ago, when I was in graduate school, one of my advisers who knew I was interested in feminism <unk> I was considered <unk> as <unk> made me a <unk> <unk>
<unk> what about female <unk>
And I thought, "It's the most stupid question I've ever heard.
Feminism has to be able to get rid of the stereotypes of gender, so there's nothing women in the <unk>
But the more I've thought about your question, the more I think that there is something female in the <unk>
I mean, there might be something, on average, something different between the female brain and the male that makes us more attached to complex social relationships and willing to help the most vulnerable.
So if I were asked by the parents were very attentive to find the way to protect people from the state, is possible to be able to have more <unk> to this concept, we might have enriched the concept of protection with the <unk>
And maybe that's what we need to do in the future when we get democracy beyond the <unk> thinking less in the individual body, in terms of identity, and to think more about relationships.
So while we tried to create a more perfect, think about what we do about each other.
Thank you.
In 2007, I decided we had to rethink how we think about economic development.
Our new goal should be that when every family thinks that when every family thinks where to live and work, has the ability to choose between at least a handful of different cities that are competing to attract new residents
Well, at this point we're far away from that target.
There are billions of people in developing countries that don't count with one town willing to <unk>
But the amazing thing about cities is that they are worth much more than its cost of building construction.
So we could easily <unk> the world -- maybe hundreds of new cities.
Well, this may sound absurd if you've never thought about new cities.
But it just led by building buildings.
Imagine that half of you would want to live in apartments either were owners and that in the other half still have no reason to do it.
They could try to increase the ability to make <unk> in all existing buildings.
But you know the problem that <unk> is that those buildings and areas that surround them have rules to avoid the <unk> and the consequences of construction.
So it would be very difficult to do all those <unk>
But you could go to a whole new place, and build a new apartment building a whole new apartment building, and when the norms of that <unk> place -- construction instead of putting it out.
So I proposed that governments are going to develop new reform areas to contain cities and gave them a name, <unk> cities.
I was later found out that I was at least at the same time, <unk> and <unk> were thinking about the challenge of political, Honduras.
Did you know that every year about 75,000 <unk> will come out of their country to go to the United States, and they wanted to ask what they could do to make sure that those people could stay and do those same things in Honduras.
In the summer of 2009, <unk> went through a constitutional crisis.
In the following elections that are <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> with a platform in which we would have reforms and the same time reconciliation.
He asked her to be his head of <unk>
Meanwhile, I was preparing to give a talk at TEDGlobal.
Through a process of <unk> trial and error and a lot of tests with users, I tried to reduce this complicated concept of cities under <unk> to their most essential.
The first point was the importance of norms, like those rules that say that you can't go and bother all the current residents of apartments.
They spend a lot of attention to new technologies, but it needs so much of technologies like rules for <unk> and usually are the rules that prevent us forward.
In the fall of 2010, a friend of Guatemala sent <unk> a link to the <unk>
I showed it to <unk>
They called me.
They said, <unk> this to the leaders of our <unk>
So in December we met in Miami, a conference room from a hotel.
I tried to explain to you this point about how valuable the cities are, much more valuable than their cost.
And I used this image that shows the value of the land in a place like New York City <unk> which, in some cases, worth thousands of dollars per square meter.
But it was a pretty abstract argument, and at some point, when there was a pause, <unk> said, <unk> maybe we could see the video of the talk <unk>
And the talk described in very simple terms that a city under <unk> is a place where a <unk> city is a place where with <unk> <unk> a <unk> which is going to be there and a choice for people to choose if they want to go or not live under those norms.
So the president of <unk> called, and told me that we had to do this project, this is important, this could be the way that our country is going on.
He asked me to be <unk> and I'd talk about new four and five of January.
So I presented another talk full of data, which included an image like this, which was trying to explain that to make a lot of value to a city, this has to be very big.
This is a picture of <unk> and the white line is the new airport that was built in <unk>
Only this airport is covering over 100 square miles.
So I was trying to convince the <unk> that to build a new city, you have to start with a site that is measuring at least 1,000 square miles.
That's more than 100,000 acres.
Everyone <unk> <unk>
The public faces were very serious and <unk>
The U.S. leader came up to the platform and said, "Professor <unk> thank you so much for his talk, but maybe we could see the video of the talk <unk>
I have here in my <unk>
So I sat down and showed the <unk>
And this explained what a new city can deliver new options for people.
There would be a city of a city that might be able to go into <unk> rather than hundreds of miles away to the North.
And we also have new options for leaders.
Because the leaders of the government of <unk> would need help from <unk> countries could benefit from countries associated and make the rules of <unk> so that everybody could trust that the <unk> effectively <unk>
We went and we saw a site.
This picture is from there.
It could be easily on a thousand square miles.
And little later, the 19 of January, they voted in Congress to <unk> their Constitution and add a constitutional ticket to allow these special brain regions.
In a country that was just going through this <unk> crisis, the voting in Congress for this constitutional <unk> was <unk> to one.
All the parties, all the <unk> in society, the <unk>
In the <unk> you have to pass two times in Congress.
The 17 of February passed over again on a voting voting for one.
Immediately after the voting voting on the 21, in October of February, a <unk> <unk> went to the two places in the world that are more interested in engaging in cities.
One of them is South Korea.
This is a picture of a new <unk> center that is building in Korea is bigger than the center of Boston.
All you see there was built in four years after they spent four years by getting the <unk>
The other country is interested in building cities is Singapore.
In fact, they've already built two cities in China and they're preparing for a third.
And if you think about this practical way, this is the point where we are.
They have a place, and they're thinking about a site for the second city.
They are preparing a legal system that would allow <unk> to be able to operate under an external legal system.
A country has been committed to allow your Supreme Court to be the court of the last instance for this new <unk> system.
There are urban and builders of cities that are really interested in the project.
They can even get some funding.
But the only thing we know that they have already solved is that they have a good number of inhabitants.
There are many companies that wanted to be installed in the <unk> especially in a place with a free trade, and there's a lot of people who would like to go to live there.
In the world there are 700 million people who say that they would like to change to another place.
There's a million a year coming out of Latin America to go to the United States.
Many of them are parents who have to leave their family to get a job, and sometimes they are young mothers who have to earn their money to just eat or buy clothes.
Unfortunately, sometimes even the kids who are trying to meet with their parents they haven't seen, in some cases, in a decade.
So what does it seem to be thinking about building a new city in <unk>
Or do you build a dozen of these, or a hundred of these around the world?
What does it seem to be thinking about doing so that families can choose between various cities that are competing to attract new <unk>
This is an idea worth spreading.
And my friends <unk> was asked to say, "Thank you TED <unk>
I'm a <unk> and this is my <unk>
But before I show you what's inside, I'm going to do a public confession and that is, I live obsessed with <unk>
I love to find, dress, and more recently, photographing and publish my blog and colorful and different <unk> and different for every time.
But I don't buy anything new.
All my clothing is <unk> of <unk> markets and <unk> <unk>
Ah, thank you.
The second hand stores allow me to reduce the impact of my <unk> in the environment and in my <unk>
I go to meet <unk> people -- usually my money goes to a good <unk> My brain looks like <unk> and buying it into my search <unk>
I mean, what am I going to find today?
It will be from my size?
I would like color <unk>
It will cost less than 20 dollars?
If all the answers are positive, then I feel I've won.
To go back to my <unk> I want to tell you what I would call for this exciting week at TED.
I mean, what brings someone who has all that <unk>
So I'm going to show you exactly what I suit.
I've brought seven pairs of clothing and nothing else.
<unk> inside a week is all I've put in my <unk>
I imagined that it would be able to find everything else that I want to use after you got here to Palm <unk>
And because they don't know me as the woman who walks at TED in clothes --  -- that means I found some things.
And I'd like to show you now the sets for this week.
Doesn't sound interesting?
As I do, I'm also going to tell you some of the lessons of life that believe it or not, I've learned in this adventure to not use new clothing.
Let's start with Sunday.
I call this a brilliant one?
You don't have to spend a lot of money to look right.
You almost always can see you phenomenal for less than 50 dollars.
All the together, including <unk> it took me <unk> and it's the most expensive that I've been used in the week.
<unk> the color is energy.
It's almost impossible to be bad humor, when you're wearing a brilliant red dream.
If you're happy, you're going to attract other happy people.
<unk> The integration is <unk>
I've spent a lot of time in life trying to be myself and at the same time.
I just know yourself.
If you get rid of the right people -- not just <unk> you also get <unk>
<unk> <unk> of the child that you're in.
Sometimes people tell me that it seems to play the <unk> or I remember your little <unk>
I like <unk> and say, <unk>
<unk> trust is the key.
If you think you do well with something, it's almost safe you are.
And if you think you don't look good at something, it's probably true.
My mother taught me this day after day.
But it wasn't until the 30 years I really understood their meaning.
And I'm going to explain it in a few seconds.
If you think you're a beautiful person inside your inner and outside, there is no look that you can't <unk>
So there's no excuse for anyone from this audience.
We need to be able to achieve everything we want to do.
Thank you.
<unk> a universal truth six words for you. The golden <unk> goes with everything.
And finally, <unk> <unk> a very unique way of telling the world something about you without having to say a word.
I've tested it again and again when people were approaching me this week just by what I was using, and we had fantastic conversations.
Obviously this is obviously not going to go into my little <unk>
So before I went home, I am going to donate everything.
Because the lesson I'm trying to learn about this week is that you have to leave certain things.
I don't need any emotionally <unk> to these things, because around the corner, there will always be another <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> if there's a little love in my heart and I look up.
Thank you very much.
Thank you.
This is a representation of your brain that we can divide in two parts.
The left-hand side, which is the logic, and the right side, which is the intuitive.
So, if you take a scale to measure the <unk> of every <unk> we could design a blueprint for our brain.
For example, this would be somebody who is completely logical.
This would be someone who is totally intuitive.
So where do you look at your brain at this scale?
Some <unk> for one of these extremes, but I think for most of the members of this audience, your brain is something like -- with a great <unk> in both of them at the same time.
It's not that they're mutually <unk>
You can be logical and intuitive.
I consider myself one of those people, which just like most other quantum physicists, <unk> we need a lot of logic to <unk> these complicated ideas.
But at the same time, we need a lot of intuition to make the experiments really work.
How do we develop this <unk> Well, we like to play with things.
We get to play with them and then we see as <unk> and then we develop our intuition from that point.
And actually, you do the same thing.
It can be intuition that you may have developed with the step of the years is the one that says one thing can be only one place at a time.
I mean, it may sound weird to think that one thing is in two different places at the same time, but you weren't born with this <unk> the <unk>
I remember looking at a kid playing in a parking bar.
It was a little boy, and he didn't do it very well, always <unk>
But I bet that playing with that bar of the parking lot taught him a valuable lesson, and that is that the big things will not allow them to get them to stay in a place.
This is a great conceptual model that can be in the world, except you're a physicist of particles.
It would be a terrible model for a physicist of particles, because they don't play the car bars and play with these little particles.
And when they play their particles, they discover that they do all kinds of really rare things -- like they can go through walls, or you can be in two different places at the same time.
And then they wrote all these observations, and they called it theory of quantum mechanics.
At that point it was the physics with a few years ago; you need from quantum mechanics to describe those little particles.
But you didn't need it to describe the big objects around us every day.
That didn't fit very well to my intuition, and maybe it's because I don't play very often with particles.
Well, sometimes I play with them, but not a lot.
And I've never seen it.
I mean, he never saw a <unk>
But it didn't fit my logical part.
Because if everything is made of little particles and all the little particles follow the principles of quantum mechanics, then I should not be able to follow the principles of quantum mechanics.
I don't find the reason why it doesn't have been.
And so I would feel much better if I could somehow prove that a common object is also following the principles of quantum mechanics.
That's why a few years ago, I proposed to do exactly that.
And I did.
This is the first object you can see that has been in an overlap of quantum mechanics.
What we see here is a little computer chip.
And you can try to see the green point right in the middle.
That's the little bit of metal that I'm going to talk about in a minute.
This is a picture of the object.
And I'm going to zoom in a little bit. It's just in the center.
And then here we make a good approach to the little <unk> of metal.
What we see is a little bit of a little little bit of metal, with a springboard with a springboard and that shows up on a platform.
And then I did this almost as a computer chip.
I went to a clean room with a silicon chip with a silicon chip and I put all the big machines for about 100 hours.
For the last material, I had to build my own machine -- to do this hole in a way of swimming <unk> which is underneath the device.
This device has the ability to be in a quantum overlap -- but for it it needs a bit of help.
Let me make an analogy.
You know how awkward it is to be on an elevator full of people.
I mean, when I'm on an elevator alone, I do all sorts of weird things, but then when other people come up with doing those things, because I don't want to do it -- or, actually, I want to make them <unk>
Quantum mechanics says that inanimate objects behave in the same way.
The <unk> of inanimate objects are not only people -- it's also the light that <unk> and the wind that happens on its side and the heat of the room.
So we knew that if we wanted this little bit of metal to behave according to quantum mechanics, we would have to <unk> all the other passengers.
And that's what we did.
<unk> the lights, then <unk> a <unk> and pulled out all the air -- and then we took it to a temperature of less than a degree by the absolute zero.
Now, when you're just in the <unk> the little little piece of metal is free to act like it.
So we measure their movements.
We found that it moved in very strange ways.
Instead of staying perfectly still, and the way they <unk> it was like a breath in this way -- like a <unk> which expands and <unk>
And by giving it a soft drive, we were able to make it <unk> and that they didn't go at the same time -- something that only happens with quantum mechanics.
So what I'm telling you is something really fantastic.
What does it mean that one thing is going to be <unk> and not at the same time?
Let's think about atoms.
In one case, all of the trillions of atoms that make up that metal piece are still still and at the same time those same atoms are moving up and down to the bottom.
It's just in certain <unk> when those are <unk>
In the rest of the time they're <unk>
It means that each atom is in two different places at the same time, which means that all the metal piece is in two different places.
I think this is great.
Really.
<unk> <unk> in a clean room to do this for all of those years to do this for all those years, because, look at this, the scale of metal is more or less the same than the difference between that little metal and you.
So if one single atom can be in two different places at the same time, and that metal piece can be in two different places, why don't you too?
I mean, it's my logical part of it.
So imagine if you were in several places at the same time, how do you be that?
How do you act your consciousness if your body is <unk> in space?
There's another part of the story.
And it is when we got it, and we turned the lights and look inside the box, we saw that the metal was still there in a single piece.
And I could get to this new intuition, apparently all the objects in the elevator are actually only quantum objects that are just <unk> in a small space.
You hear a lot about that quantum mechanics is claims that everything is interconnected.
Well, that's not so true.
It's more profound than that.
It's that those connections, your connections to all the things that surround you, literally define who you are, and that's the deep strangeness of quantum mechanics.
Thank you.
My name is <unk>
And it took 18 months to do another work at Google, until I launched the idea of doing something related to museums and art to my head that's here and that allowed me to do it.
It took me 18 months.
Many <unk> stories, <unk> with 17 very interesting museums in nine countries.
But I'm going to focus on <unk>
There's a lot of stories from why we did.
I think my own story is explaining to just this slide and this is the access.
I grew up in India.
I was born with a great education -- but I didn't have any access to many of these museums and artwork.
So when I started traveling and go to museums, started to learn a lot.
And working on Google, I try to make the desire to make it more accessible by technology.
So we formed a team, a great team of people, and we started doing it.
So better than it shows the demo to then explain to you a couple of interesting things that we've done from their launch.
So, let's go back to <unk>
Look around all the museums there.
There's the <unk> gallery <unk> the <unk> the <unk> the <unk>
I'm actually going to go into one of my favorite -- the <unk> the art museum in New York City.
There are two ways to do it -- very simple.
We click on it, and <unk> we're inside the museum.
No matter where they are, <unk> or <unk> that doesn't really matter.
You move around and <unk>
They want to navigate the <unk>
We opened the top, and with one click click on it.
They're inside, you want to go to the end of the hall,
Come forward. What would you get?
<unk>
Thank you, but I haven't come to the best.
Now I'm in front of my favorite paintings, "The <unk> of Pieter <unk> in the <unk>
I see the <unk> sign here.
If the museum shows us the image, we click on it.
See, this is one of the images.
Here's all the information <unk>
For those of you who are really interested in art, you can click there, but I'm going to click this right now.
And this is one of the images that we've captured in what we call <unk> technology.
So this image, for example, <unk> I think, about 10,000 million pixels.
And there are many people who ask me, "What do you get with 10,000 million <unk>
So I'll show you what you really get with 10,000 million pixels.
It can zoom in around a very simple way.
You see fun things that are happening.
I love this guy, his expression doesn't have a price.
But if you really want to make it out.
So I started to play, and I found something that would happen there.
And I said, "Wait a moment, this seems <unk>
I walked in, and I discovered that kids were actually playing something.
And I did a little bit, I talked to some people from the <unk> and I actually discovered that this is a game called <unk> which is to hit a <unk> with a stick, with a Tuesday <unk>
And apparently it was very popular.
I don't know why they did, but I've learned something about it.
And now we're going to get even more deep into and you'll see that you can actually get even into the cracks.
Now just to give you a little bit of perspective, I'm going to take the picture, so you'll see what there is.
This is where we were, and this is the picture.
The best thing is to come, a second.
So now we're going to go back again at MoMA in New York.
Here's another one of my favorites, <unk>
The example I showed was to find details.
But what if you want to see the <unk>
And if you want to see how Van Gogh actually created this <unk>
It increases and it really makes it happen.
I'm going to one of my favorite parts in this picture, and I'm really going to get to the cracks.
This is <unk> <unk> I think I had never seen it before.
I'm going to show you another one of my favorite functions.
There's a lot of things over here, but I don't have time <unk>
This is the really great. It's called <unk>
All of you, absolutely no matter whether it's rich or poor, or if you have a <unk> that gives you the same.
You can online create their own museum, create their own collection from all of these images.
It's very simple, we walk in, I've created this function that I call "The <unk> <unk> -- we've just done a zooming around.
It's about <unk> at the National Gallery in London.
You can write things, send it to your friends and keep a conversation about what you feel like looking at these works <unk>
So in conclusion, I think for me, the main thing is that all amazing things really don't come from Google.
No, in my opinion, even also comes from museums.
Maybe I shouldn't say this.
Actually, they come from those artists.
And that's been my humble experience with this.
I mean, I hope that in this digital medium makes justice to their art and it's represented properly online.
And the big question I'm doing today is: "You did this to repeat the experience of going to a <unk>
And the answer is no.
It's to supplement the experience.
And that's it. Thank you.
Thank you.
Good evening everybody.
I have something to show you.
Think of this is a <unk>
In our lab, we call it sensitive design.
I'm going to tell you a little bit about this.
If you look at this picture -- I'm about Italian, all of the children in Italy grow up with this photo on his bedroom. But the reason I show you this is that it has been a very interesting thing in fishing careers one in the last two decades.
Some time ago, if you wanted to win a career career, one, I would take a budget and get it to a good race and a good car, a good car.
And if the car and the pilot were good enough, you made the race.
This is what it is, in engineering, it was <unk> in real time.
It's essentially a system that has two <unk> a sensor and a <unk>
Now, what's interesting is that the control systems in real time are starting to go into our lives.
Our cities, in the last few years, have been covered with networks and electronics.
They're becoming <unk>
And as <unk> are starting to respond differently and can be <unk> and <unk>
<unk> cities is big.
As a note on, I wanted to mention that cities are only two percent of the Earth's cortex but they represent 50 percent of the world's population.
75 percent of the consumption of <unk> and to 80 percent of the CO2 emissions.
If we could do something with the cities, it would be a big thing.
Beyond cities, all these <unk> and <unk> are entering our everyday objects.
This is from an exhibition of <unk> <unk> at the end of the year at MoMA, during the summer.
It's called <unk>
Well, our objects, the environment, the environment, they start to <unk>
In a way, it's kind of like almost all of the existing atoms were coming back and get sensors and <unk>
And that's constantly changing the interaction that as humans have with the outside environment.
It's almost like the old dream of Miguel <unk>
You know, when Michelangelo <unk> the <unk> said that at the end, he took the hammer and threw it into the Moses -- you know, you can actually see a little bit of a <unk> <unk> and he said he said, <unk> <unk> <unk> And so why don't you <unk>
Well, today, for the first time, our environment starts to <unk>
And I'm going to show you just a few <unk> <unk> in the idea of getting the environment and press something.
Let's start with the detection.
The first project I wanted to share with you is actually one of the first projects in our lab.
This was four years ago in Italy.
It was a summer of 2006.
It was the year in which Italy won the World Cup in the World.
Maybe some of the remember, they were playing Italy and France, and at the end, he gave the <unk>
And anyway, I won Italy.
Now let's see what happened that day by looking at activity on the network.
Here we see the city.
You see the <unk> in the middle and the river <unk>
It's the morning before the game.
The line of time is at the top.
By the afternoon there are people here and there are <unk>
It starts <unk> silence.
<unk> from France.
<unk> people do a quick call and goes to the bathroom.
Second time. End of time.
First time <unk> second.
<unk> and at a moment, the <unk>
They win Italy, yeah!
That night all went to <unk> at the center.
There you see the big summit.
The next day we all went to the center of the winning team and the first minister of then.
And then all the world <unk>
You see the picture of the place called <unk> <unk> where, since the <unk> people are going to <unk> it's a great party, you can see the spike at the end of the day.
This is just an example of how you can measure the pulse of the city in a way that we couldn't do just a few years ago.
Another quick example of <unk> is not about people, but things we use and consume it.
Today, we know all about the source of our objects.
This is a map that shows all of the chips that make a <unk> how it was <unk>
But we know very little about where things are.
So in this project, we developed some small tags to track the trash in its system through the system.
We started with a few volunteers who helped us in Seattle a little bit more than a year, to label what they were doing, different kinds of things, as you can see, things that are <unk>
Then we put a little chip, one tag on the garbage and then we started <unk>
These are the <unk> results.
From <unk>
after a week.
With this information, we realized that there are a lot of <unk> in the system.
We can do the same with a lot less energy.
These are data that didn't exist yet.
They're going on complicated things and there's a lot of <unk>
But the other thing that we think is that if you look at every day that the cup that we <unk> doesn't go away, which is still somewhere on the planet.
What if the plastic bottle that we <unk> one day is still there.
And if we showed it to people, then we will be able to promote some change of behavior.
That was the reason for the project.
My colleague of MIT, <unk> <unk> could tell us a lot more about detection and many other things that we can do with that, but I wanted to go to the second part we talked about at the beginning, which is actually <unk>
And the first project is something we did a couple years ago in <unk>
It all began with a question of the mayor of the city, who came up and told us that Spain and South Europe have a beautiful tradition of use of water in public spaces in the architecture.
And the question was, how can technology, new technology, join that?
And one of the ideas that we develop at MIT, in a garage, was, imagine you have a <unk> and <unk> valves from <unk> <unk> you open and <unk>
It creates like a curtain of water, with pixels of water.
If you fall out the pixels can be written in them, to show patterns patterns, images texts.
And when you zoom in, the curtain will open up so that we can happen, as you see in the image.
We introduced this to the Mayor <unk>
He liked a lot.
And we had a commission to design the building to the entry of the <unk>
We call it a <unk> <unk>
All the building is made of water.
There are no windows, no windows, but when you come up to it, it opens up so you can happen.
The ceiling is also covered in water.
And if there's a little bit of wind, if you want to minimize the <unk> you go down the ceiling.
Or you can close the building and all the architecture goes down as in this case.
Those days there will always be somebody, in the winter when the roof, someone who was there and said, <unk> the <unk>
No, it's not that they had it, but when you go down almost the whole architecture goes down.
Here it is.
You see people <unk> by what's going on.
And here I'm myself trying to do not <unk> by testing the sensors that open the water.
I think I should tell you what happened one night when all the sensors stopped working.
That night was really more fun.
All the children of <unk> came to the building because the way we interact had changed a little bit.
It was no longer a building that would open up to let them happen, but a building that followed <unk> and water holes and one had to jump to <unk>
<unk> <unk> And for us that was very interesting because architects engineers, designers, we always think about using people to give our designs.
But then the reality is always unpredictable.
And that's the beauty of doing things so that people use.
This is a picture of the building with the physicists and the pixels of water, and of projections on them.
And this is what led us to think about the next project I'm going to show you.
Imagine that those pixels could start to fly.
Imagine that they could have little helicopters in the air and each one had a little pixel that changes color as if it was a cloud that moves in space.
This is the video.
Imagine a helicopter, like the one we saw earlier, which moves with others in synchrony.
Could we form this cloud,
A kind of flexible screen like this with a normal configuration in two dimensions.
Or a normal, but in three dimensions, where what it changes is light, not the position of the pixels.
You can play it with a different guy.
Imagine that the screen appears on different scales and sizes, in different types of resolution.
And then all of that could be a cloud of pixels in the building that you can get closer and <unk> and see from very different <unk>
This is the real <unk> <unk> going down to form a <unk> as they had before.
When the light comes up, you see this. The same thing we saw before.
Imagine each of them controlled by one person.
We can have every pixel with an input that comes from people, the movement of people, and so on.
I want to show you something for the first time.
We've been working with <unk> <unk> <unk> of the best dancing dancers of the <unk> of New York City and <unk> <unk> to capture their 3D motions and use them as input for <unk>
Here we can see <unk> dancing.
On the left you see the <unk> the <unk> in different <unk>
It's so many 3D <unk> in real time as a movement capture.
It can make all the movement.
You can go around the way.
And once we have the pixels we can play with them, with the color and the movement, with gravity and <unk>
We want to use this as a possible entry for <unk>
I wanted to show you the last project we're working on.
It's something for the London Olympics.
It's called the <unk>
And the idea is, imagine again, that we could engage people to do something and change our <unk> environment, like a <unk> operation like <unk> but with a cloud.
Imagine that we could all be able to make it a little bit about a <unk>
And I think what remarkable has happened in the last few years is that, in the last two decades, we went from the physical world to the digital world.
We've digitized everything like knowledge, and it's accessible to the Internet.
Today, for the first time -- and the Obama campaign is <unk> we can go from the digital world, of the <unk> power of the networks, the physical world.
In our case, this may we want to use it to design and make a <unk>
That would mean something built in a city.
But tomorrow it can be to address the challenges of today: think about climate change or emissions of CO2. How to move from the digital world to the physical world?
The idea is that we can make people involved in doing this together.
The cloud is a cloud, again, made of pixels in the same way that the actual cloud is a cloud of particles.
And those particles are water, whereas in our cloud are pixels.
It's a physical structure in London, but he covered in the pixels.
You can move through the inside, having different experiences.
You can see from the bottom of the major moments of the Olympics in 2012, and even more, and it can be used as a form of connection with the community.
So it's a physical cloud of the sky as something that you can rise, as a new top of London.
You can go there.
As if it was a new digital <unk> at night, but the most important thing is that it will be a new experience for anyone who goes to the top.
Thank you.
I'd like to be better than they are.
Suppose I told you that, with just a few changes in their genes, they could better improve the <unk> for a more <unk> and faster.
Or maybe they would like to be in better ways, being stronger to have more resistance.
Would you like to be more attractive and <unk>
What about living more with good health?
Or maybe be those people who always wanted to be more creative.
What is the most thing that you would do?
What would you like if you could choose something?
<unk> from the Audience: <unk> <unk>
How much people are creativity?
Raise your hand. Let me see.
<unk> probably got to the number of creative creative people.
That's very good.
How many would the memory?
A few more.
And the <unk> state.
A little less.
What about <unk>
Oh, most of them makes me feel very well as a doctor.
If you could have something of this the world would be very different.
It's just <unk>
Or maybe it is possible?
Evolution has been a <unk> topic here at the TED Conference but I want to give you the eyes of a doctor on the subject.
The great <unk> of the 20th century, <unk> <unk> that also <unk> in the <unk> Church, <unk> wrote an essay called "Nothing in biology makes sense to the light of <unk>
But if you effectively accept biological evolution consider this: it's just about the past, or the future?
It's about the other or us?
This is another look at the tree of life.
The human part of this branch, good at one end, it is, of course, the most interested.
<unk> of a common ancestor with modern chimpanzees about six or eight million years ago.
There have been maybe 20 or 25 different species of <unk>
Some have gone and <unk>
We have been here about <unk> years.
It might seem like we're far away from other parts of this tree of life, but actually, in most of the basic machinery of our cells is more or less the same.
You realize that we can leverage and control the machinery of a common bacteria to produce the protein of human insulin which is used to treat <unk>
This is not like human insulin but it's the same chemically <unk> protein, of the <unk>
And talking about bacteria -- you realize that we all carry on the gut in the gut that the cells that we have in the rest of the body?
Maybe 10 times more.
I mean, think -- when Antonio <unk> raises the <unk> they think about <unk>
The gut is a wonderfully expensive environment for those bacteria.
It's warm and <unk> that's very <unk>
And we're going to provide all the nutrients that they can want without effort to <unk>
It's really like a quick pathway for the bacteria with the occasional disruption of some rush <unk>
But therefore we are a wonderful environment for those bacteria in the same way that they are essential to our life.
They help digest nutrients <unk> and they protect us from certain diseases.
But what does the future?
We're in a kind of evolutionary balance as a species?
Or it meant to become something different, something perhaps better adapted to <unk>
In this vast <unk> of the universe, the life on Earth is like a brief <unk> the animal kingdom, as one and only <unk> and human life, a little note of grace.
That was us.
And it was also the <unk> part of this talk so I hope you've got to be <unk>
When I first went to college I had my first class of biology.
I was fascinated by the elegance and the beauty of biology.
I fell in love with the power of evolution, and I realized something fundamental in most of the existence of life, in the <unk> organisms that are simply <unk> and all the genetic energy of that cell is transmitted to the two daughters.
But when organisms appear that organisms start to change.
It goes into scene sexual reproduction.
And something very important, with the emergence of sexual reproduction that happens the genome, the rest of the body becomes <unk>
In fact, one could say that the <unk> of the death of the body is in evolution at the same time of sexual reproduction.
I have to <unk> that when I was a college student, I was thinking, well, <unk> <unk> death by <unk> it seemed pretty reasonable at that moment, but with every year that was happening, every time I had more <unk>
I came to understand the feelings of George <unk> who still <unk> in Las Vegas in their 90 years.
And one night someone hit his door door to a hotel.
He opens the door.
In front of him is a gorgeous <unk> of clothes.
And he looks at him and he says, "You know, <unk> for a <unk> <unk>
"Okay, says, "I choose the <unk>
I realized, as a doctor, who was working for a different aim at the goal of <unk> not necessarily <unk> just different.
I was trying to preserve the body.
I wanted to be healthy.
I wanted to get health into the disease.
I wanted us to live more and more healthy.
Evolution is going to move the genome to the next <unk> adapting and <unk> generation after generation.
From an evolutionary view of view, you and I are like <unk> rockets that are designed to send the genetic burden to the next level, and then let me fall into the sea.
I think that all of us -- the feeling that expressed Allen when he said, "I don't want to achieve the immortality through my work.
I want to <unk> it not <unk>
Evolution doesn't necessarily have longevity.
They don't necessarily engage the largest or the stronger or the most quickly and even more smart.
Evolution favors the best adapted to their environment.
That's the only survival for survival and success.
In the bottom of the ocean -- the bacteria <unk> that can survive the heat of the <unk> that would be <unk> if there were fish there, <unk> fish in the empty, yet they've managed to make that a <unk> environment.
So what does this mean when we look at what's happening in evolution and if you go back to thinking about the place of humans in evolution, and in particular, if we look forward, at the <unk> phase -- I would say there's a lot of possibilities.
The first is that you don't know.
We've reached a kind of balance.
And the idea of the underlying reasoning would be that through medicine, first of all, we've known to preserve a lot of genes that otherwise would have been <unk> and <unk>
And secondly, as a species, we have <unk> our environment for us as well as we adapt to it.
And by the way, <unk> <unk> and we will get so much that it is no longer possible to have the isolation that we need to impact evolution.
A second possibility is that you produce a evolution of the kind of traditional type, dictated by the forces of nature.
And the argument here is, that the gears of evolution roll slowly, but they're <unk>
And as soon as the <unk> as a species -- distant planets, are going to be the isolation and the environmental changes that can produce natural evolution.
But there's a third possibility -- an overwhelming person, intriguing and terrifying possibility.
I call it <unk> the new evolution, which is not just <unk> but <unk> and elected by us as individuals in the decisions that are <unk>
Now, how could this happen?
How could we get to do this?
So first consider the reality that many people today, in some cultures, they're making decisions about their offspring.
In some cultures, they're choosing to have more males than women.
It's not necessarily good for society, but it is what you choose to the individual and family level.
So think as well as it could be possible to choose not only the sex of their <unk> but in their own body to make genetic modifications to cure or prevent disease.
And if we could make genetic changes to eliminate diabetes or Alzheimer's or reduce the risk of cancer or eliminate the <unk>
You wouldn't want to make those changes in their genes.
If we look at the future that kind of changes is going to be more and more possible.
The Human Genome Project started in 1990 and he sued 13 years.
<unk> million dollars.
The next year, in 2004, I could do the same work for 20 million dollars in three or four months.
Today, you can get a full sequence of the three billion base pairs of the human genome at a cost to the 20,000 and a week.
Not so much to make the human genome actually makes the human genome for <unk> and to be more and more and more and more of the rest of all.
They come up with those changes.
The same technology that has produced the human insulin of bacteria can make viruses that are not only going to protect us from themselves, but they are going to inform other viruses.
<unk> or there's no experimental trial in the course of the vaccine against the flu flu cells in a tobacco plant cells.
Can you imagine something good that comes from <unk>
That's reality today and the future is going to be more and more possible.
Imagine then only two other <unk>
They can change the cells of their bodies, but if they could change the cells from their <unk>
And if you could change the sperm and the <unk> or change the <unk> egg or giving their children a better chance of a healthier life, eliminate the diabetes, to eliminate the <unk> to reduce the risk of cancer?
Who doesn't want more <unk>
And then that same <unk> technology, that same engine of science that can produce the changes to prevent diseases is going to allow us to adopt <unk> <unk> a better memory.
Why don't you have the ingenuity of an Ken <unk> especially if you were able to <unk> the next generation of the machine <unk>
Why don't you have a <unk> muscle that allows us to run faster and more <unk>
Why don't you live more time?
This is going to be <unk>
And when we're in conditions of pass this to the next generation and we can adopt the attributes we wanted to become the evolution of before in the <unk>
We're going to take a process that normally could take 100 thousand years and we can give it to 1,000 years and maybe happen within the next 100 years.
These are choices that their grandchildren, or our grandchildren are going to have to have them.
We're going to use these choices to make a better society more successful, more successful <unk>
Or are we going to selectively tolerate different attributes that we want for some of us but not for the others?
We're going to build a society that's more boring and more <unk> and more robust and more <unk>
This is the kind of question we're going to have to face.
And most profound of all, we're going to be able to develop the wisdom and inherit the wisdom necessary to make these <unk> decisions.
For better or for worse, and before what you might have to, these choices are going to depend on us.
Thank you.
Imagine a great explosion when you're at 900 feet tall.
Imagine a plane full of smoke.
Imagine a motor doing <unk> <unk> <unk>
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> sounds terrifying.
Well, I had a single seat that day. I was sitting in the <unk>
It was the only one who could talk to the flight.
So he immediately looked at it, and they said, "There is no problem. You probably slam some <unk>
The pilot had already taken off the airplane, and we were not so far.
You could see Manhattan.
Two minutes later, three things happened at the same time.
The pilot <unk> the airplane with the Hudson River.
Mostly that's not the way.
<unk> the motors.
Imagine being in an airplane and without <unk>
And then he said three words.
The three most <unk> words ever heard.
He said, <unk> for the <unk>
I didn't have to talk about the flight.
I was able to see it in his eyes.
It was terror. Life <unk>
I want to share with you three things that I learned about myself that day.
I learned that everything changes in a moment.
We have this list of things to do before they died, these things that we want to do in life, and I thought about all the people I wanted to get and I didn't did, all the fences I wanted to <unk> all the experiences I've wanted to have and never <unk>
While I was thinking about that, I came up with a sentence, which is, <unk> wines <unk>
Because if the wine is ready and the person is there, I'm going to open.
I don't want to have any <unk> in life.
And that urgency, that's really changed my life.
The second thing that I learned that day -- and this is the way that I went through the bridge George Washington, which was not for much -- I thought about, Wow, I really feel a great <unk>
I've lived a good life.
In my humanity and my mistakes I've tried to improve everything I did.
But in my humanity I also give up my ego.
And I'm sorry for the time that I <unk> in things that don't care about people who do matter.
And I thought about my relationship with my wife, with my friends, with the people.
And then, as a <unk> in that, I decided to remove the negative energy of my life.
It's not perfect, but it's much better.
In two years, I haven't had a fight with my wife.
It feels like <unk>
Now I'm not trying to have <unk> <unk> being <unk>
The third thing I learned -- and this is like your mental clock is going to <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
You see the water <unk>
I'm saying, "Please <unk>
I don't want this to be left in 20 pieces as you see in those <unk>
And as I <unk> I had the sensation of, Wow, die doesn't fear fear.
It's almost like we've been <unk> for it all our life.
But it was very sad.
I didn't want to hate me. I love my life.
And that sadness is <unk> in a single thought, which is, I just wish one thing.
I wish I could see my kids grow.
One month later, I was in a performance of my daughter -- first grade, not a lot of artistic talent --   And I scream, <unk> as a small kid.
And for me, that was all the reason for the world.
At that point I understood that two points, which matters in my life is to be a great father.
For most of all, the only goal I have in life is to be a good father.
He gave me a miracle of not dying that day.
And he gave me another gift that was the possibility of looking at the future and to go back and live in another way.
You guys are flying today, the challenge that you can imagine that the same is going on in your plane -- and for you, it's not the way -- but imagine, and how to <unk>
What is it that you might expect to do because they think they're going to live <unk>
How do you change their relationships and negative energy in them?
And most importantly, they are the best parents ever <unk>
Thank you.
I have clearly been <unk> in life with many <unk> projects.
But the biggest thing I worked was for this guy.
The guy is called <unk>
<unk> was one of the most important <unk> in the 1980s.
One day he came to his house after running and said, "Dad, I feel a <unk> in the <unk>
And that was the beginning of ALS.
Today we have complete paralysis today.
You can only use your eyes.
Her work influenced me.
I have a design firm and animation and animation -- obviously, is something intricate that we admire and <unk> in the world of art.
So we decided that we were going to <unk> <unk> <unk> and their cause.
So I went and I met her brother and her father and I said, "We're going to give you this money.
What are you going to do with <unk>
And his brother said, "I want to be able to talk to Tony again.
I just want to be able to communicate with it, and he's able to communicate with me."
And I said, "A second, it's not that <unk> I saw Stephen <unk> not that all people with paralysis can communicate through those <unk>
And he said, "No, unless you're going to be a major person and you have a very good insurance -- you can't actually do it.
These devices are not affordable for people."
And I said, "Well, how do they communicate then?"
Does anyone see the movie "The <unk> and <unk>
They communicate from that way, and they are going to take it with the finger.
I said, "That's <unk> How could it be?"
So I presented with the only desire to deliver a check and instead of that signed a check that I didn't have the least idea of how it was going to be <unk>
I stood up with her brother and her father there at the very very moment, <unk> well, this is the <unk> Tony is going to talk, we're going to build a machine, and we're going to find a way to make their art again.
Because it's a ridiculous thing that someone who has so much inside your inner can't be able to <unk>
So I talked about a conference a couple months later.
I met these guys called <unk> <unk> Research <unk> who have a technology that lets them project a light on any surface and then with a laser laser pointer that's about that and register negative space.
So they go out there doing art facilities like this.
All the things that <unk> they say, are part of a life cycle.
First of all, they start with the sex organs, then with the bad words, then with the <unk> and in the end, people start to do art.
But there was always a cycle of life in their <unk>
And so it started the journey.
And about two years later, about a year later, after a lot of organization and a lot of moving things on one side we had achieved a couple of things.
One, we touch the doors of insurance companies and we got a machine so that they could <unk> a machine like Stephen <unk>
Which was great.
And seriously, is the hardest thing -- I call him <unk> because when you talk to the guy you get an email from it, and you say, "Don't <unk> this guy's <unk>
The other thing that we did was bring seven programmers from all over the <unk> world from every single corner of the <unk> to our home.
My wife, the kids and I, we moved to the back garage and these hackers and programmers and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> took control of the house.
A lot of our friends thought that we would do something completely stupid and that when they did, they would have taken the frames out of the walls and in their place there would be <unk>
But for two weeks, <unk> went to the <unk> walk of my son -- my son was part of me, and we created this.
It's called <unk> <unk> and you can see the <unk>
They are a couple of empty sun glasses that we bought in the <unk> <unk> Beach, some copper wire and <unk> <unk> and Radio <unk>
We take a <unk> camera, we put it on a light of LED light, and there's a device that is free -- and it builds up, we published the <unk> code -- the software is low in a free.
And we created a device that has no limitation at all.
There is no insurance company.
There is no hospital that I can say, "No."
Anyone with paralysis today has access to draw and communicate with just your eyes.
Thank you.
Thank you very much. That was amazing.
So at the end of the two weeks we went back to the <unk> room.
I love this picture because this is the room of another person, and that's his room.
There was all this <unk> and <unk> during the big opening.
And then over a year of planning two weeks of reading intense sessions of all night, Tony came back for the first time in seven years.
And this is a wonderful picture because this is the life support system and it's looking through the support system of his life.
We ran the bed so I could see.
And we put a projector on a wall on a wall outside the hospital.
And he went back to draw for the first time in front of his family and friends -- and you can imagine what the feeling was in the parking lot.
The funny thing was that we had to take in the parking lot, so we felt like we were <unk> as well.
At the end of this he sent us an email and this was what he said, "This was the first time I drew in seven years.
I felt like I had been under the water and someone finally came to <unk> and take me out there so I could <unk>
It's not <unk>
In a way, that's our scream for war.
That's what keeps us in motion, <unk>
And we have a long way to go through this.
This is a cool device, but it's the equivalent of a <unk> curve.
Someone with this artistic potential it deserves a lot more.
So we're trying to figure out how to go and make it faster and robust.
Since then, we've had all kind of recognition.
We've won a lot of awards.
Remember, it's <unk> none of us is doing money with this.
Everything comes out of our own pockets.
<unk> were like, "Oh, this is great!"
Armstrong <unk> something about us, and then, the Time magazine recognized us as one of the 50 best inventions of 2010, and it was really great.
The best thing about this -- and this is what ends up about close the <unk> is that in April this year in the <unk> of the <unk> in the center of Los Angeles is going to be an exhibition called <unk> in the <unk>
And <unk> in the <unk> is going to have the best <unk> of urban art, <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> all of them are going to be there.
<unk> is going to be on the show which is pretty impressive.
So basically this is my idea: if you see something that isn't possible, do it possible.
None of what there is in this room was possible -- the stage, the microphone, the <unk> -- nothing was possible at a certain time.
Make it <unk> anything in this room.
I am not programmer, I had never done anything with <unk> <unk> technology -- I just recognized something, and I was reminded of wonderful people to be able to make it happen.
And these are the questions I want you to do all of us every day when we find it with something that we feel to be able to do, if it's not now, <unk> And if I'm not me, who?
Thank you guys.
I've spent the last few years <unk> in very difficult situations and at the same time a dangerous time.
I went to the hard <unk>
I worked in a <unk> <unk>
Film <unk> difficult and dangerous.
And I spent 30 days by eating a little fun at first, something difficult in the middle, very dangerous at the end.
In fact, in a lot of my career, I've been <unk> in a lot of my career, with the only goal to try to look at social issues in ways that are going to make attractive, interesting attractive, and, hopefully, analyzing a way that you see useful and accessible to the audience.
So when I knew I was going to come here to make a TEDTalk about the world of brands and <unk> I wanted to do something a little bit differently.
So some of you may have heard about it, or not, a couple of weeks ago, I took a <unk>
I sent some messages on Facebook, some on Twitter, I offered the rights of the name of my TEDTalk from 2011.
What I had was this: <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> my TEDTalk that you have no idea what and the content could be <unk> in the face, especially if I put it in ridiculous you or your company to do it.
But I said this, it's a very good opportunity to do that.
Do you know how many people look at these <unk>
<unk>
It's a title in progress, by the way.
So even with that <unk> I knew someone was going to buy the rights of the name.
If you had done it a year ago, I had not been able to <unk> it with certainty.
But in the new film that I'm working on, we tested the marketing world.
And as I said earlier, I've been in horrible situations in the last few years, but nothing could be done with anything as hard as it could get to the room with these guys.
You see, I had this idea for a movie.
Morgan <unk> I want to make a film that is about the <unk> of products, marketing and advertising, and that the whole film is <unk> with <unk> of products, marketing and advertising.
The film is going to call "The largest film ever <unk>
What happens in "The largest film I never <unk> is that all the top at the bottom, at the end, has images of brand, all the time; from the <unk> that appears before the title of the title, the <unk>
Now this brand <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
These people were approaching the film to <unk> forever.
And so the film explores all this idea -- <unk> <unk> is <unk> It's <unk> It's <unk> A <unk>
I'm a <unk> <unk> <unk> It was just <unk>
Was it <unk> <unk> forever."
But we're not just going to have the sponsor of the X brand in the title of the title, but we're going to make sure out of running all the categories that we can in the film.
Maybe you get a shoe, and it becomes the most cool shoe that you've ever met.
The most cool car that you've driven in the greatest film ever <unk> the best drink that you <unk> <unk> from "The greatest <unk>
<unk> <unk> The idea is then besides showing the brands as part of life, making them <unk> the <unk> -- MS: And we actually show the whole process of how it works.
The goal of the entire film is transparency.
You'll see all the process in this movie.
That's the whole idea, all the shot of beginning to end.
And I would love you to help make it happen.
Robert <unk> You know, it's funny because it's the first time I hear that -- it's the most respect for the audience.
<unk> However, I don't know how to <unk> it is going to be people at that.
<unk> You have a <unk> -- I don't know if you <unk> it's very <unk> but you know how it goes to <unk> <unk> not <unk> David <unk> How much money does it need to do this?
MS: A million and a half a <unk> Very <unk> John <unk> I think it's going to be hard the meeting with them, but certainly it's going to be worth convincing a couple of big brands at all.
<unk> Who knows, maybe for the moment that the film is going to look like a whole bunch of idiots <unk>
MS: What do you think is going to be the answer?
Stuart <unk> Most of the answers will be broken.
MS: But it's going to be hard to <unk> by the film or be I?
JK: Both things.
MS: <unk> means you're not very optimistic.
So, I got <unk> I need help.
MK: I can help.
MS: All right. <unk> Awesome. Awesome.
MK: We need to think about which brands.
MS: Yeah. <unk> That's the <unk> When you look at people you have to <unk>
MK: We have some places where to go. <unk> <unk> <unk>
MS: I thought that <unk> meant we have a conversation outside the microphone.
<unk> the camera means "We don't want to know anything about your <unk>
MS: And so it was, one of these companies suddenly disappeared.
No wanted to have anything to do with this movie.
I was surprised.
They didn't want to know anything with this project.
And I was very <unk> I thought the concept of advertising, it was to present the product as possible, so that so many people can see him as possible.
Especially in the world today this intersection of new media and old media scenario and stage scenario is not the idea to have that new vehicle worthy of attention that is going to take the message to the <unk>
No, that's what I thought.
But the problem was, you see, my idea had a <unk> error and that error was this.
There was actually no mistake.
There was no mistake at all.
This would have been right.
But the problem was what this image.
See, when you search images of <unk> on Google <unk>   -- this is one of the first images you know.
I like your way of <unk> Sergey <unk> No.
This was the problem: The free simulation of simulation or <unk> easily detected or <unk> easily <unk> which is characterized by the visibility or access of information, especially in <unk> practices being the last line perhaps the biggest problem.
You see, we heard a lot about transparency in these days.
Our politicians <unk> the president of the <unk> even the <unk>
But suddenly when it comes to the fact that it really changes a sudden changes.
But why? Well, transparency gives <unk>  like that <unk> bear still <unk>
It's <unk>   Like this rare rural path.
And it's also very risky.
What else is <unk>
<unk> a whole bowl of <unk> <unk>
That's very risky.
When I started talking to the companies and tell them we wanted to tell this story, and they said, "No, we want us to have <unk> history.
We want a story, but we want a story, but we want to make some story."
See, when I was a kid, and my father came up to me at some lie -- and there he is looking at me as he used to say, "Son, there are three sides in every story.
It's your story, it's my story, and there's the story <unk>
As you can see, in this film we wanted to tell the real story.
But with only one company, a agency wanting to help me -- and that's just because I knew John Bond and Richard <unk> from many years -- I realized I would have to go through my own, and I would have to take out the <unk> and go to the companies myself with all my team.
So what I started to see is that what I started to see is that I started giving me <unk> is that when you start talking to the companies -- the idea of understanding your brand is a universal problem.
MS: I have friends who make big, big, giant big, giant big, giant movies, like mine.
And my friends who make films of big, giant Hollywood films say that the reason their films are so successful because of the brands that they have.
And then my friends who do independent films say, "Well, how are we supposed to compete with these big, giant movies of <unk>
And the film is called "The largest film ever <unk>
How are we going to look specifically <unk> in the movie?
Every time I'm going to go out, every time I open my <unk> you'll see the <unk> <unk>
At any time during an interview with someone I can say, "Are you good for this <unk>
You're ready? You see a little bit nervous.
I want to help you to <unk>
Maybe you should put a little bit of this before the <unk>
And there would be one of these <unk> <unk>
<unk> <unk> like <unk> of <unk> are going to have their opportunity.
We're going to have so much for man as to <unk> solid, <unk> in bar, whatever.
That's the look at the picture.
Now I can answer your questions and give you a look at <unk>
Karen Frank: We are a small brand.
<unk> the kind of smaller films that we <unk> are more well a <unk>
So we don't have the budget that has other brands.
So doing things like that, you know, remind people of the reason why this interests us.
MS: How words would you use to describe <unk>
<unk> is blank <unk>
<unk> That's a great question.
Volunteer: technology.
MS: Technology is not the way you want to describe something that you put in the <unk>
Man: We talk about something bold <unk>
I think <unk> is a great word that actually puts this category in positive versus <unk> the smell and the <unk>
It keeps you.
How do you keep you cool more time? With better <unk> more <unk> three times <unk>
Things like those who are <unk> the benefits.
MS: And that's a company <unk>
What about me? What about the common kind of <unk>
I need to talk to the guy from the street, to the people like me, to the common <unk>
They have to tell me about my brand.
MS: How do you define your <unk>
Man: <unk> my <unk>
I don't know.
I like good clothing.
Woman: reviving the 1980s, <unk> <unk> unless it is <unk>
MS: All right, what is the <unk> <unk>
<unk> Something unique. <unk> <unk> Man: I guess the type of gender, the style I have would be like a <unk> <unk>
I like the dark colors, a lot of gray colors, a lot of things like that.
Usually I carry on me as a sun, or I like the <unk> and the same thing.
Woman: If Dan was a brand could be a brand <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
Man 2: The brand I am, I would call it <unk> <unk>
Woman 2: At part of <unk> in part of <unk> <unk> I don't know.
Man 3: I'm the kind of pets.
<unk> toys for pets in the country and in the world.
So I guess that's my brand.
In my little sector, that's my brand.
Man 4: My brand is FedEx because I would take the <unk>
Man 5: <unk> <unk> failed.
Is that something?
<unk> I'm a <unk>
<unk> I'm a <unk>
MS: Well, we can't all be a Tom, but I often get <unk> at the intersection of <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk>
I realized I needed an expert.
I needed somebody who could go into my head, someone who could help me understand what they call <unk> <unk>
And I found a company called <unk> <unk> in Pittsburgh.
They helped companies like <unk> <unk> <unk> to discover that <unk>
If they were able to do it for them, they surely could do it for me.
<unk> <unk> the photos, right?
MS: Yeah. The first picture is a familiar picture.
A: Tell me a little bit about how it relates to your thoughts and feelings your way to be.
MS: These people shape my way to see the world.
A: Tell me about that world.
MS: So that world? And I think your world is the world that you think -- as people around you, your friends, your friends, the way you live in your life, the work you do.
All those things come in, and they start in a place and in my case where you start in and start in my family, in West Virginia.
A: What's the next thing you want to talk about?
MS: The next is "This was the best day of my life."
A: How does this relate to your thoughts, feelings and your way to be?
MS: It's like who I'd like to be me.
I like the different things.
I like <unk> things like weird things.
A: Tell me about the <unk> for what is why we do that?
What is the <unk> What a phase of <unk> you find you now?
Why is it important? What is <unk>
Tell me a little bit about that.
A little more about you, who is not who you are.
What other <unk> have you <unk>
They don't have to be afraid of what kind of Russian mountain are you?
MS: <unk> <unk> Thank you.) No, thank you.
A: thank you for your patience. <unk> Great <unk> Yes. <unk> Thank you very much.) All right.
MS: Yeah, I don't know what's going to come out of this.
There was a lot of madness on this.
<unk> <unk> The first thing I saw was this idea that there are two different sides of it, but <unk> in your personality <unk> the Morgan <unk> mark, is a <unk> brand.
They were very good together.
And I think there's almost a paradox in them.
And I think some companies are only <unk> in one of their strong dots or in the other instead of focusing on both.
A lot of companies tend to do a lot of companies -- and it's <unk> nature to avoid the things that are not <unk> they avoid fear, and you actually give them something positive for you, and it's nice to see that.
What other brands are this?
The first here is the classic Apple.
And you can also see here to <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk>
Now there are <unk> parallel marks and <unk> those things that have gone and come in, but a <unk> brand is pretty powerful.
MS: One <unk> What's your <unk>
If someone asks you to put your identity into your brand, your personality style, which would be?
You're a <unk> attribute you someone who makes blood <unk>
Or are you a <unk> attribute of it.
A little bit more <unk> <unk> <unk>
<unk> attributes are kind of playful being cool as the <unk> contemporary <unk> <unk> <unk> or audacious as <unk> <unk> <unk> the dominant world or mystical or mystical <unk>
Or are you more like <unk>
You're <unk> sophisticated as <unk>
Are you <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
You are reliable stable, family <unk> safe, sacred, <unk> or wise as the Dalai Lama or <unk>
Over the course of this film we had over 500 companies, <unk> and <unk> who said <unk> they didn't want to be part of this project.
They didn't want to have anything to do with this movie, mainly because they would have no control, you wouldn't have control of the final product.
They allowed us to tell the story of the <unk> and we came up to tell the story in this film of how we can now use MRI to identify the desire centers in the brain as much for movie marketing as to movies.
We went to San Paulo where they've been forbidden to open open.
In the entire city for the last five years, there's no <unk> there's no <unk> no <unk> no <unk>
And we went to school districts where companies are getting on the way in schools with money problems in the U.S.
And the amazing thing to me is that the projects that I have had the greatest answer or the ones that I've had more success are those in which I've interacted with things directly.
And that's what these brands.
<unk> the <unk> took out to their donor agencies, and they said maybe these agencies don't have my best interest in mind.
I'm going to try directly with the artist.
I'm going to work with him to create something different, something that is going to challenge people, which is going to challenge the way we look at the world.
And how has it gone? They got it success?
Well, since the movie was released in the <unk> Festival -- let's take a look.
According to <unk> the movie was launched in January, and since then -- and this is not <unk> we've had 900 million impressions in the media for this film.
This covers just a period of two weeks and a half.
That's just in <unk> no press or TV.
The film is still not <unk>
It's still not online. It's not in <unk>
It's not even presented in other countries yet.
Ultimately, this film has begun to win momentum.
And it's not bad, because almost all of the agencies that we're talking about, they will tell their customers not to be part.
I've always believed that if you get risks, if you take risks, that in those risks are opportunity.
I think when you get the people that are pushing them to failure.
I think when you train their employees at loss of aversion at risk is preparing all of their company for <unk> for rewards.
I feel that what happens to happen to move forward is we need to encourage people to <unk>
We need to encourage people who are not afraid of opportunities that can be <unk>
Ultimately, to move forward, I think we need to give it to fear.
We need to put that bear in a cage.
<unk> fear <unk> the risk.
From one <unk> at a time, we need to embrace the risk.
And ultimately, we need to support transparency.
Now more than ever a little bit of honesty is going to go a long way.
And I said this, with honesty and transparency, all of my talk <unk> the <unk> has been introduced by my good friends of <unk> who for <unk> bought the rights of the name in <unk>
<unk> <unk> big data in great opportunities for companies around the world.
<unk> is <unk> <unk>
Thank you very much.
June Cohen: I was able to get the name of transparency, which happened exactly with those <unk>
MS: It's a fantastic question.
In my pocket I have a check to the name of the extracellular matrix of the <unk> Foundation, a check by <unk> to be applied to my TED TED year.
The idea behind the <unk> computer worm is actually very simple.
We don't want Iran to get the nuclear bomb.
Their biggest asset to develop nuclear weapons is the <unk> plant in <unk>
The gray boxes that you see are systems of control in real time.
If we were able to compromise these systems that control and <unk> we can have a lot of problems with <unk>
The gray boxes don't use <unk> software -- are a completely different technology.
But if we were able to put a free cash virus in a laptop used by an engineer to set up this gray, and then we're ready.
This is the plan behind <unk>
We started with a Windows.
The <unk> enters the gray, <unk> <unk> and the Iranian nuclear program is <unk> mission.
It's easy, <unk>
I want to tell you how we discovered this.
When we started to research on <unk> about six months ago, the purpose was completely unknown.
The only thing that you knew is that it's very, very complex at the part of the <unk> the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
It seemed like to want to do something with these <unk> <unk> these control systems.
That called us the attention, and we started an experiment in which we took our environment with <unk> and we saw what happened with this.
So they went very strange things.
<unk> was <unk> like a laboratory rat that didn't like our <unk> the wave, but I didn't want to eat.
I had no sense for me.
And after experimenting with different flavors of cheese, I realized, and I thought, this is a <unk> attack.
It's completely <unk>
The <unk> is actively looking at the gray box if you find a specific configuration, and even if the program is trying to infect it is actually working on that <unk>
If not, <unk> does nothing.
So that called my attention, and we started working on this almost 24 hours a day, because we said, "We don't know what's the <unk>
Could it be, let's say, for example, an energy plant of the United States, or a chemical plant in Germany.
better than you can get the goal soon.
So we pulled out the attack, and we found out the attack, and we found that it was <unk> on two pumps -- a small and a big one.
We also saw that they were very armed armed with people that obviously had the entire internal information.
They would have all the dots to attack.
You probably even know how much <unk> the operator.
So you know everything.
And if you've heard that <unk> <unk> is complex and high technology, let me tell you, the burden is very complex.
It's very above everything we've seen before.
Here you see a sample of this code of attack.
We're talking about 15 thousand lines of code.
It looks like old language <unk>
I want to tell you how we could find sense of this code.
What we were looking at at the beginning was called the functions of the system, because we know what they do.
Then we were looking at <unk> and <unk> and we tried to engage with the real world, with potential goals of the real world.
We need theories about recipients that we can pass on or <unk>
To get to theories about goals, we remember, it's definitely a violent <unk> because it's a violent valuable, and it's surely located in Iran, because the majority of the infections has been <unk>
You don't find several thousand goals in that area.
It basically boils down to the nuclear power plant of <unk> and the <unk> plant <unk>
So I said to my <unk> <unk> a list of all the experts in <unk> and power plants between our <unk>
I called them and I encouraged them to an effort for <unk> their experience with what we find in code and data.
And it worked pretty well.
So we were able to associate the little digital <unk> with control of the <unk>
<unk> is that mobile part inside the <unk> that black object you see.
If you run the speed of this <unk> you can certainly <unk> and even make the <unk> <unk>
What we also saw is that the goal of the attack was making it slow and <unk> in an obvious effort to get back to the nest engineers so that they couldn't solve this quickly.
We tried to figure out the big digital <unk> looking very close to the data and their structures.
So for example, the number <unk> <unk> in that code, you can't get it out.
I started to investigate scientific literature about how these <unk> are built in <unk> and found that they're <unk> in what's called a <unk> and each waterfall contains <unk> <unk>
That was a sense, there was a coincidence.
And it got better yet.
These <unk> in Iran are <unk> in 15 parts called stages.
And guess what we found in the code of <unk>
A almost <unk> structure.
So again, that was a good coincidence.
This gave us a lot of confidence in understanding what we had between hands.
And so it wasn't like this.
The results have been from several weeks of hard work.
<unk> <unk> <unk> and we had to go back to start.
Yet, we discovered that both digital <unk> were to one and a goal, but from different <unk>
<unk> small is taking a <unk> and making the <unk> and <unk> and the big <unk> communicates with six <unk> and manipulating <unk>
In <unk> we're very confident that we've determined what the <unk> is.
It's <unk> and it's just <unk>
We need no worry that other goals are <unk> by <unk>
Here I show you some very interesting things that we saw, really <unk>
There's the <unk> and up the <unk> and the <unk>
What this thing does is <unk> the entry values of sensors for example, from the <unk> sensors and provides a <unk> code, which is still running during attack, with false data.
And believe it or not, these false input data is <unk> by <unk>
It's like in Hollywood movies where, during the <unk> the security camera is <unk>
It's great <unk>
The idea here is obviously not just <unk> the operators in the control room.
It's really much more dangerous and <unk>
The idea is <unk> a digital security system.
We need digital security systems where a human operator could not act fast.
For example, in an energy plant, when the large steam turbine is happening, you have to open <unk> valves in a <unk>
Obviously, this can't do a human voice.
That's where we need digital security systems.
And when they're <unk> then you can go through bad things.
The plant can explode.
And the <unk> and the security system is <unk>
That scares me.
But it can be worse.
What I'm going to say is very important.
Think about this. This attack is <unk>
There's nothing to see, specifically, with <unk> with <unk> <unk>
Could it work as well, for example, in an energy plant, or in a <unk>
It's <unk>
And you don't have <unk> <unk> that disseminate this burden with a key <unk> as we saw in the case of <unk>
You could also use conventional technology of worms to <unk>
<unk> the most possible.
And if you made that, with what they <unk> is a <unk> of mass destruction.
That's the consequence that we need to face.
Unfortunately, the largest number of goals are not in the Middle East.
It's in the United States and Japan.
All the green areas are spaces with a large number of goals.
We need to deal with the consequences and better than we start to prepare now.
Thank you.
Chris Anderson: I have a question.
<unk> has been public in many sides that people assume that <unk> is the main entity behind this.
What is your <unk>
Ralph <unk> OK, you really want to listen to this?
Yeah. <unk>
My view is that the <unk> is involved, but the engine is not <unk>
The engine behind this is the <unk> superpower there.
There is one alone, and that's the United States, fortunately, I <unk>
Because, in another way, our problems would be even larger.
CA: Thank you for <unk> Thank you, <unk>
So I want you to imagine a robot that can take you and give them <unk> abilities or another one that makes users of wheels get up and get a walk.
In <unk> <unk> we call these robots, <unk>
They are nothing different from something that is put in the morning, gives you a great force -- which also increases your speed, and you help, for example, drive the balance.
It's actually the real integration of man and the machine.
But not only that -- it can integrate it and connected it to the universe and with other things that are <unk>
This is not a <unk> idea.
So to show you now in what we're working on, we start talking about the American soldier who, on average, has to take over their back a load of 45 pounds, and it's <unk> to take even more team.
Obviously, this leads to some important complications and injuries on the back, at 30 percent of the soldiers -- with chronic <unk>
We decided to look at this challenge and create a exoskeleton that could help drive the matter.
Let me introduce you to <unk> -- or <unk> <unk> Universal Internet.
Soldier: With the <unk> I can <unk> 90 pounds for land for many hours.
His flexible design, it allows you to put in <unk> <unk> and running movements with great <unk>
<unk> what I want to do, or where I want to go, and then it increases my strength and my <unk>
<unk> <unk> We're ready, with our industrial partner to produce this device, this new <unk> this year.
I mean, it's a reality.
Let's go back now to the users of chairs of wheels, on what I feel particularly passionate about.
There are 68 million people out of roughly, in chairs of the wheels, around the world.
Like one percent of the population population.
And this is a really conservative.
We talk about something that happens very often, very young people with the spinal cord that when they start their life -- 30 or 40 years -- collide against a wall and the wheelchair turns out to be its only option.
We also talk about the population that are going to be added up very quickly.
Her only option, many times -- by a brain injury, or some other complication -- is the wheelchair.
And this has been this for the last 500 years, from their successful <unk> as I should recognize.
So we decided to start by writing a new chapter about mobility.
Let me introduce you to the <unk> which is using Amanda <unk> who 19 years ago, he had an injury in the neocortical column and as a result couldn't go back for 19 years now, so far.
Amanda <unk> Thank you.
EB: Amanda is using our <unk> who <unk>
It's got some sensors -- it has some sensors.
Not <unk> in crutches that send signals to board, here on the back.
There are also batteries here that give the motors into the <unk> and on the knees and make it progress with this and very natural <unk>
AB: I had 24 years at the top of my life when, by a strange leap in the air, skiing down the bottom <unk>
In a fraction of a second, I lost all feeling and all movement <unk>
Little time later, a doctor walked into my room in the hospital, and he said, <unk> never come to <unk>
That happened 19 years ago.
So I stole it to the last bit of hope of my self.
<unk> technology since then, has allowed me to learn how to <unk> it costs the bottom in <unk> climbing rocks and even ride into <unk>
But they haven't invented anything that allowed me to walk, so far.
Thank you.
EB: As you can see, we have the technology, we have the platforms for sitting and talk to you.
It's in our hands, and we have all the potential here to change the life here to change future generations -- not just soldiers, but at the side of all users of chairs of the wheels, all of you all.
AB: Thank you.
I've just come back from a community that has the secret of human survival.
It's a place where women have <unk> practice sex to say hello, and the game is the order of the day -- where fun is serious.
And no, it's not the <unk> <unk> <unk> or San Francisco.
Ladies and gentlemen, you know their cousins.
This is the world of wild Bonobos in rainforests of Congo.
The bonobos are along with the chimpanzees, their closest living relatives,
That means that we all share a common ancestor, an evolutionary grandmother that lived about about six million years ago.
Now, chimpanzees are known for their <unk>
But unfortunately, we've been too focused on this aspect of our narratives of human evolution.
But the bonobos show us the other side of the coin.
Whereas chimpanzees are dominated by men, <unk> the Iraqi society is in charge of females with power.
These guys have created something special because this leads to a very highly tolerant society where violence is still not <unk>
But unfortunately, the bonobos are the least <unk> of the great apes.
They live in the depths of the bush <unk> and it's been very difficult to <unk>
Congo is a <unk> an extraordinary land of extraordinary biodiversity and beauty, but also the heart of the <unk> <unk> scenario that has been <unk> by decades and caused almost as many deaths as the First World War.
No wonder that this destruction will also put the survival of the Bonobo.
The meat trade of hunting and deforestation is that you can't fill in a stadium with the bonobos who are in the world -- and honestly we're not sure of it.
However, in this land of violence and chaos you can hear that hidden laughter hidden in the trees.
Who are these <unk>
We know them as the apes <unk> the love, not <unk> because they have <unk> sex, <unk> and <unk> to handle conflict and solve social problems.
I'm not saying that this is the solution to all of the problems of humanity because the life of the Bonobo is more than the <unk> <unk>
<unk> like humans, love to play throughout their entire life.
Play is not just a children's game.
For us and for them the game is fundamental to establish bonds and encourage <unk>
We learn to <unk> and we learn the rules of play.
The game increases creativity and resilience and has to do with the generation of <unk> diversity of interactions, diversity and diversity of connections.
And when you look at the red game you see the roots of the feeling of the laughter, the dance, and the human ritual and the human ritual and the human ritual and the human ritual and the human ritual and the human ritual and the human ritual and the human ritual and the human ritual and the human ritual and the human ritual and the human ritual and the
The game is the glue that comes together.
I don't know how you play you, but I want to show you a couple of unique videos from the wild.
First, it's a <unk> ball game, and I don't talk about football game.
Here we have a female and a young male in the middle of a <unk>
Look at what she is.
Could it be the evolutionary origin of the phrase: <unk> <unk> <unk>
I just think that in this case he loves him, right?
Yeah.
So sexual game is common as much in Bonobos as in humans.
And this video is really interesting because <unk> this video is really interesting because it shows the invention of bringing unusual elements into the game, like the <unk> and also how the game requires trust and <unk> and the same time is the most fun.
But the game is <unk>
The game is <unk> it can adopt many ways, some of which are more <unk> <unk> <unk> maybe the place where wonder.
And I want you to <unk> this is <unk> a young female who is playing with a <unk>
I think that like her, sometimes we played themselves, and we explored the limits of our inner worlds and outside.
And it's a playful curiosity that drives us to explore, interact. And then the unexpected connections that we form are the real <unk> of creativity.
These are just small samples of the understanding that Bonobos give us from our past and present.
But they also have a secret for our future, a future where we have to adapt to a more and more difficult world with greater creativity and greater cooperation.
The secret is that play is the key to these abilities.
In other words, the game is our <unk> of <unk>
To adapt to the success of a world that changes have to play.
But do we get to the most of our ability to stop.
The game is not <unk>
The game is essential.
For Bonobos and humans for the same, life is not just cruel and <unk>
When it looks at least proper play, you can be the moments in which it's the most urgent thing.
And so fellow primates, we will accept this gift of evolution and play together as we <unk> creativity, friendship and wonder.
Thank you.
In New York I'm responsible for development of a nonprofit organization called Robin <unk>
When I'm not fighting poverty, <unk> fires as a captain of a captain in a fire body volunteers.
And in our city, where the volunteers are given to a highly qualified staff to get to the fire site very soon to enter action.
I remember my first fire.
I was the second volunteer at the site, so I had a pretty high probability of go.
But there was still a race to foot against the other volunteers to get the captain in charge and figure out what our task was.
When I found the <unk> he was <unk> in a conversation with the owner that I certainly went through one of the worst days of his life.
We were at the end of the night, she was standing outside in the rain, under a <unk> in her pajamas and his house was on fire.
The other volunteer that had just gotten before me, <unk> <unk> <unk> --  first came up to the captain and he asked her to go back and would save the dog <unk>
<unk> I was <unk> <unk>
There I was a lawyer or a <unk> of money that during the rest of his life, I would have to tell the people that I entered a call to save a live living because I won for five seconds.
Well, I was the following.
The captain made me a <unk>
He said, <unk> I need you to join the house.
I need that <unk> <unk> the fire, and it brings this woman a couple of shoes."
I <unk>
It wasn't exactly what I hoped but I was looking at the stairs, at the end of the hall, I went to the <unk> firemen that go down to that height of that height and went into the fourth room in search of a pair of shoes.
I know what you're thinking, but I'm not a hero.
I took my load back through the ladder where I met my <unk> and the lovely dog in the front door.
<unk> from the house for the house office where, as they would expect, his treasure was got much more attention than mine.
A few weeks later, the department got a letter from the house owner of her home <unk> by the brave effort to save her home.
And the kindness that she looked at over the other was that someone had reached a couple of shoes.
And so much in my calling in Robin <unk> as in my calling as a resident witness of acts of generosity and kindness on a <unk> scale, but also of <unk> and courage to the individual level.
And you know what I've learned?
Everything has its importance.
So when I look at this room to people who have made, or they're for <unk> remarkable levels of success, I'd like to remind you this: Don't wait.
Don't wait for the first million to make a difference in somebody's life.
If you have something to give up to giving, you get now.
<unk> food in a dining room, a park in the neighborhood.
They're mentors.
Not every day we're going to have the opportunity to save someone's life, but every day we're going to influence someone's life.
So I trained the <unk> <unk> the shoes.
Thank you.
Bruno Giussani: Mark, Mark, comes back.
Mark <unk> Thank you.
This may seem strange, but I'm a big fan of the concrete block.
The first blocks of concrete were built in <unk> with a very simple idea of cement in a fixed measurement that fit together.
Very quickly, these became the most used construction unit in the world.
They have allowed us to build things bigger than us, as buildings or bridges, a brick at the time.
So essentially, these blocks have become the pillars of our time.
Almost a hundred years later, in 1947, the <unk> came up with this.
He called him brick <unk>
And in a few years, the <unk> bricks came to every home.
It's estimated that they've been made over 400 billion or 75 blocks per person on the planet.
You don't have to be an engineer to build beautiful bridges or houses.
<unk> made it accessible.
<unk> simply adopted the concrete block in the world, and it turned it into a fundamental piece of our imagination.
Meanwhile, exactly that same year, in the competitive labs, the next revolution was about to <unk> the new block of construction.
The transistor was a small plastic unit that would lead us from a world of <unk> <unk> piled on some other to a world where everything was interactive.
Just like the concrete block the transistor allows you to create much larger circuits and more complex, one brick at the time.
But there's a <unk> difference -- the transistor was only for experts.
I personally don't know what the building blocks of our time are being reserved for the experts, so I decided to change it.
Eight years ago, when I was at the Media Lab, I started to explore the idea of bringing the power of engineers to the hands of artists and designers.
A few years ago, I started to develop <unk>
I'm going to show you how they work.
<unk> are electronics every one with specific function.
They're <unk> to be light, sound, motors and sensors.
And the best thing about everything is that they put together through necessity.
So you cannot be put in the wrong way.
The bricks have a colored code.
The green is the side, the blue is the stream, the pink is the input and the orange color is the wire.
So only you have to assemble a blue one with a green one, and very quickly you can start to make bigger circuits.
One blue with a green one that makes light.
Can we put a button in the middle, and we have a <unk>
If we change the button for a pulse module that is here, and now we have a light <unk>
We put this <unk> to create more impact and have a noise.
I'm going to stop this.
So beyond the simple game, <unk> are actually very powerful.
Instead of having to program, connect and <unk> <unk> it allows us to program using a very simple gestures, very simple gestures.
To make it faster or more slow, <unk> just turn this button that makes your pulse faster or slower.
The idea behind <unk> is that it is a planetary collection.
We want all of the interactions in the world to become <unk> to use.
<unk> <unk> solar panels, <unk> must all be accessible.
We have given to the kids to see them playing with them.
And it's been an incredible experience.
The best is how they start to understand the electronics of every day you don't learn in schools.
For example, how does a light at night, or why the door of an elevator is moving, or how an iPod responds to touch.
We've also led to design schools.
So for example, designers without any electronic experience are starting to play with <unk> like a material.
Here you can see, with paper bottles and <unk> we have <unk> <unk>
<unk> a few weeks ago, we took <unk> to the designers of <unk> School of Rhode Island -- that they have no experience in engineering -- just and wood and paper and said, <unk> something.
Here's an example of a project that has actually done, a <unk> <unk> <unk>
But wait, here's my favorite project.
It's a <unk> <unk> who is afraid of darkness.
For these no engineers, <unk> became another material, electronics became another material.
And we want this material to all of you all.
So <unk> has open source.
You can visit the website, you can download all of the design files and <unk>
We want to encourage a world of creators, inventors and collaborators because this world in which we live, this interactive world is ours.
So again, and <unk>
Thank you.
I'm going to talk to you today about unexpected discoveries.
I work in the solar technology industry.
And my little company is looking for to get involved in the environment to focus on.
The distributed collaboration.
This is a little video of what we do.
<unk> Wait for a moment.
Can you take a little bit in <unk>
<unk> we can continue to get the video next to one side.
No.
This is not ...
All right.
The solar technology is ...
Oh, I have the time time?
All right. Thank you very much.
A couple of years ago I launched a initiative to recruit the best designers and technicians to take a year and work in an environment that represents almost everything that we are supposed to do to work in government.
The initiative was called <unk> for <unk> and it would be like a bunch of Peace <unk>
<unk> some members every year and we put them working with the <unk>
Instead of getting them to the Third World we send them into the wild world.
They did great <unk> they worked with <unk>
Your task is to show the possibilities of today's technology.
<unk> <unk>
The city is in Boston.
Here it looks like if you were looking for a quote, but what you really find is that somebody else has been caught by the snow because he knows it's not very good by turning fires when it's covered by a meter of snow.
How did it come to ask for help in this <unk> way?
Last year in Boston we had a team of members of <unk> for <unk>
They were there in February and at that moment -- so much last year.
They realized that the city never wiped these <unk>
But one of the members called Erik <unk> I noticed something else -- that citizens would have <unk> the sidewalks right in front of them.
So he did like any good programmer, I developed an app.
It's a nice application where you can take a <unk>
You embrace <unk> when you get it.
When you do that, you put a name, in this case he got him <unk>
If you don't do, someone can <unk>
I mean, it has a component playground.
It's a modest application.
Maybe it's the smallest of the 21 apps -- last year.
But it does something that no other technology of the government <unk>
And it extends <unk>
A responsible system of <unk> <unk> when you see this app that I could use it, not for snow, but for citizens to get <unk> <unk>
It's very important that they work these <unk> of tsunami, but people are <unk>
That's why the citizens of the <unk>
And then Seattle decided to use it to make the citizens <unk> <unk> <unk>
And Chicago ends up in order to make people <unk> to clean sidewalks when they <unk>
So now we know about nine cities that are using, using it.
And this has been spread without <unk> and natural ways.
If you know a little bit of government technology, you know that this doesn't happen.
<unk> acquisition usually takes a couple of years.
Last year in Boston we had a team working on a project that took three people for two and a half months.
It was a tool for the parents to choose the best public school for their children.
Then they told us that by the normal channels it would have taken at least two and a half million dollars.
And that's nothing.
Now there is a project in the justice justice project that the moment has 2,000 million dollars and doesn't work.
And there's projects like this at every level of government.
So an app that has been program in a couple of days and <unk> in viral is a kind of shooting warning to the institution of government.
It suggests the government of the best ways to work, not as in private companies as many people think it should be.
It's also not like a technological company, but rather like the Internet.
I mean, without <unk> in the middle and <unk>
And that's important.
But the most important thing about this app is that it represents the way to address the question of the government that has the new <unk> not as a problem of an <unk> institution but as a collective action problem.
And that's very good because it turns out we are very good for the collective action with digital technology.
And there is a very large community of people who are building the tools so that we were building together with efficacy.
And it's not just <unk> for <unk> but there are hundreds of people all over the country that contribute to <unk> apps every day in their own communities.
They have not been given to the government.
Do you feel a great frustration at that, but they don't get <unk>
And these people know something that we've lost from view.
And that is that if we leave the feelings of politics, the line in the <unk> <unk> <unk> and all those other things that make us crazy, the government is essentially in words of Tim <unk> "What we do together because they alone don't know.
Now, a lot of people have abandoned the government.
If you are one of those people, I would ask you to do it, because things are changing.
The politics is not <unk> the government itself.
And because the government ultimately comes from -- you remember that <unk> the <unk> the way to think about it will affect the way it will produce change.
I didn't know a lot of government when I started with this.
And as a lot of people thought the government was to choose people to choose to <unk>
Well, after two years I've come to the conclusion that the government is, especially a matter of <unk>
This is the heart of services of services and information.
It's the place that serves the calls if you draw <unk> in the U.S.
Scott <unk> this call.
He entered the basis of official knowledge.
I didn't find anything. It started with animal control.
And he finally said, "Hey, you can open the doors of the house, put it very strong and see if they were <unk>
And it worked. So well for Scott.
But that wasn't the end of the <unk>
Boston doesn't have a phone center.
It has a application, web and mobile, called <unk> <unk>
They didn't have that app.
It was the work of very smart people in the New York Office in Boston.
One day, this really comes up with this <unk> <unk> in my trash.
How do I do for <unk>
<unk> <unk> <unk> is different.
Scott was talking to a person.
In <unk> <unk> it's all public, so everybody can see this.
In this case, he saw it a neighbor.
The next report said, "I went to the place, I found the garbage cube behind the house.
<unk> Yes. <unk> Yes.
I went home. I went home.
Good evening, sweet <unk>
Quite simple.
This is great. It's the confluence of digital and physical.
And it's also a great example of the income of government to the distributed <unk>
But it's also a great example of government as a platform.
And here I don't necessarily mean the definition of technological platform.
I'm talking about a platform so that people will be <unk> and to help others.
So, a citizen helped another but here the government had a key role.
connected two people.
And I could have connected to the government services of being necessary but the neighbor is a better alternative and cheaper than the government services.
When a neighbor helps another other help to another, we would save the communities.
If we call the control of animals, it costs a lot of money.
One important thing we need to think about the government is that it's not the same as politics.
A lot of people are doing it, but think that one is the input of the other.
That our input to the government is the vote.
How many times have you chosen a political leader, and sometimes we spend a lot of energy to choose a new political leader, and then we hope that the government will support our values and <unk> our needs, but then we don't see changes.
That's because the government is like an immense ocean and politics is the surface of <unk>
That's what we call <unk>
And we say that word with a lot of contempt.
But it is that <unk> what that belongs to us that we funded as something that operates in our against, that other thing, and in a consequence we're losing power.
People believe that politics is sexy.
If we want this institution to work we'll have to make the bureaucracy sexy.
Because that's where the real work of government happens.
We need to collaborate with the machinery of government.
That makes the movement <unk>
Have you <unk>
It's a group of citizens worried that they have written a very detailed report of 325 pages in response to the order of the <unk> <unk> of <unk> on the financial reform project.
That's not political activism -- it's activism <unk>
And for those of us who have <unk> to the government, is time to ask ourselves, why world we want to leave our children.
You have to see the huge challenges that they will have to face.
Do you really believe that we will get to where we have to go without solving the institution that can act on behalf of <unk>
We can't do without government, we need to be more effective.
The good news is that with technology is possible to rethink the root function of government so that it can expand to civil society.
There's a generation that grew up with the Internet and knows it's not so hard to act <unk> only is to articulate the systems in the right way.
The average age of our members is 28 years old, so I am a generation older than many of them.
This is a generation that has grown up taking the word and giving that almost for granted.
They're not giving that battle that we all face on who are going to be able to talk to each other.
They can express their opinions in any channel at the same time and they do.
So when you face the government problem that the government doesn't care very much to hear their voices.
They're using hands.
They treat the work to program applications that do better to government.
And those applications allow us to use hands to improve our communities.
It can be cleaning up a <unk> taking away from a garbage cube that has a <unk> inside.
Of course, we were always able to get those <unk> and a lot of people do it.
But these applications are as a digital <unk> that we are not only consumers, we're not only consumers of government that we are <unk> and we get services.
We are more than that: we are citizens.
And we're not going to fix the government until we don't get the <unk>
So I want to ask everyone here, when it comes to the important things that we have to do together, we will be a crowd of voices, or also there are a crowd of hands?
Thank you.
This is for me a real honor.
I've spent most of the time in the prisons, the prisons and the death corridor of death.
I have spent most of my life in communities in <unk> and places where there's a lot of despair.
And I'm here at TED watching and hearing these stimulus have given me a lot of energy.
One of the things I've noticed in this short time, is that TED has identity.
And the things that are telling you here have impacts all over the world.
Sometimes if something comes from TED, it makes a sense and a force that would not have a different way.
I say this because I think identity is <unk> important.
Here's fantastic presentations here.
And I think we've learned that the words of a teacher can make a lot of sense, but if you teach that feeling, they can have special meaning.
A doctor can do good things, <unk> if it's <unk> it can get a lot more.
So I want to talk about the power of identity.
I didn't really learn this in the practice of law, my job.
I learned it from my grandmother.
I grew up in a traditional house of a <unk> family, dominated by a <unk> who was my grandmother.
It was hard it was strong, it had power.
It was the last word in all discussion in the family.
She <unk> many of the <unk> in our home.
He was a daughter of people who had been slaves.
His parents were born in slavery in Virginia about <unk>
She was born about the <unk> and his experience with slavery <unk> the way the world looked like.
She was hard -- but it was also <unk>
When I was a little bit, and I looked at her, she was approaching me, and I was a good hug.
I was so hard that I could barely breathe and then <unk>
One or two hours later, I went back to <unk> I was approaching me, and he said, <unk> you still feel my <unk>
And if I said no, I was going to give me again and if I said yes, I was left in peace.
He had this human quality that would always wish to be close to it.
The only problem is that I had 10 children.
My mother was the lowest of 10.
Sometimes when I was going to spend a time with her, it wasn't easy to capture his time and his attention.
My cousins were running around.
I remember when I was eight or nine years old, I woke up one morning, and I went to the room, and there were all my cousins.
My grandmother was on the other side of the room and looked at me <unk>
I thought it was a game.
And then he looked at him and I was like, but she was very serious.
After 15 or 20 minutes, she got up, went through the room, and he took me out of my hand, and he said, "Come on, <unk> <unk>
I remember this as if it was yesterday.
I'll never forget it.
It took me outside and said, <unk> I'll tell you something, but you can't say it to <unk>
I said, "Okay, <unk>
She said, "Now <unk> I didn't know. I said, "Sure."
Then I sat down, I looked down, and he said, "I want you to know that I've been <unk>
And <unk> <unk> you're <unk>
He said, "I think you can do what you want.
I'll never forget it.
Then he said, "I want you to ask me three things, <unk>
I said, <unk> <unk>
And he said, "The first thing I want you to ask me is that you always want your mother."
<unk> "She is my <unk> and you have to believe it that always <unk>
Like I was <unk> to my mom, I said, "Yes, <unk> so I did it.
Then he said to me, "The second thing I want you to tell me is that you will always be doing the right thing as the right thing to be <unk>
I thought about it, and I said, "Yes, <unk> And so I did it!
And then finally he said, "I third thing I want you to tell me is that I never <unk> <unk>
I was nine years old, and I said, "Yes, <unk> like that.
I grew up in the field, in South Africa, I have a brother a year older and a sister a younger year.
When I was 14 or 15, one day my brother came home with a <unk> package -- I don't know where the <unk> grabbed us to my sister and I went to the forest.
We were just doing the <unk> of the time.
He took a sip of beer, offered my sister, she took a little bit and offered me to me.
I said, "No, no, no. It's okay. You guys -- but I'm not going to take <unk>
My brother said, <unk> today I <unk> And you always do the same thing as we do.
I took something, your sister as well.
I said, "No. I wouldn't feel good, you can <unk>
Then my brother looked at me <unk>
And he said, "What's going on? Take a <unk>
I went back to the force and <unk> and he said, "Oh, it's not that you're still thinking about the conversation with <unk>
I said, "What are you talking about?"
He said, <unk> tells everybody the grandchildren that are <unk>
I was <unk>
I have to admit something to you.
I'll tell you something I probably shouldn't say.
I know this will spread <unk>
But I have 52 years old, and I can admit I've never taken a drop of alcohol.
I'm not saying this is a <unk> I mean by the power that has the identity.
When we create the right type of identity, we say things to the others who really don't make sense.
We can't get to do things that they don't think of being able to do.
I think my grandmother naturally believed that all his grandchildren were special.
My grandfather had been a prisoner during the <unk>
My daughters died of age-related diseases.
And these were the things that it was, according to it, we had to <unk>
Now, I'll try to talk about our criminal justice system.
This country is very different from what was 40 years ago.
In <unk> there were 300,000 prisoners.
There are 2.3 million.
In America we have the largest incarceration rate in the world.
We have seven million people in parole.
And this mass <unk> in my opinion, has fundamentally changed our world.
In poor people, or black, you find so much <unk> so much some of these facts.
One of the three black is between the 18 and 30 years is in prison or parole.
In urban <unk> across the country, Los Angeles, Baltimore, Baltimore -- Washington, by 50 to 60 percent of all young people in color are in prison or parole.
Our system is not just distorted in front of race, it's also about poverty.
In this country we have a judicial system that is much better if you're rich, and <unk> than if you're poor and innocent.
It's not <unk> but wealth is affecting the results.
And it seems like we feel very <unk>
The fear of fear and anger are making us believe that these are not ours.
We are <unk>
It looks interesting.
We're looking at our work with some good developments as curious.
In my state, in Alabama, as well as in other states, you give you a rights for always if you have a criminal <unk>
Right now in Alabama, the <unk> of the black male population has definitely lost the right to vote.
And if we showed it to the next 10 years, the level of loss of rights will be as high as it was before it was before the law of the right to vote.
We have this awesome silence.
I represent children.
A lot of my customers are very young.
America is the only country in the world that was sentence at 13 years to die in prison.
We have in this country prison for children, without a chance to go back.
Right now we're in the process of some <unk>
The only country in the world.
They were talking to people at death <unk>
This issue of death penalty is interesting.
In some sense, you've been reminded of the final question that the final question is, people deserve to die by the <unk> <unk>
A very sensitive question.
But you can think of another way about how we are in our identity.
There's another form of <unk> it is not about deciding whether people deserve to die by crimes <unk> but if we deserve to kill.
This is interesting.
<unk> death in America is defined by mistake.
From every nine <unk> people have identified one which is innocent who is <unk> and liberated from death <unk>
One rate of error -- an innocent rate of every nine.
This is interesting.
In aviation it would not allow you ever to fly airplanes if in every nine that you would have, you would have <unk>
But somehow we get rid of the problem.
It's not our problem.
It's not our charge.
It's not our fight.
I talk a lot about these things.
I'm talking about race and this issue of whether we deserve to kill.
It's interesting that in my classes with students on <unk> history, I'm talking about slavery.
I'm talking about terrorism, the age of the reconstruction of the rebuilding and that lasted to World War II.
We don't really know a lot about this.
But for the black Americans in this country, it was a little defined by terror.
In many communities people were afraid to be <unk>
They were worried about being <unk>
The terror threat was what they defined their lives.
Now there are people older people who come to me and say, "Mr. Stevenson, and they say, "Mr. Stevenson, who says, <unk> people who stop saying that in our history we deal with the first time with terrorism, after <unk>
They ask me to say, "No.
The age of terrorism went out of course, with the segregation and decades of women, race and <unk>
In this country we have a dynamic that we don't like to talk about our problems.
We don't like to talk about our history.
And that's why we haven't understood the meaning of what we've historically done.
All of the time I would get to each other.
We constantly create tensions and conflict.
It costs us to talk about races. I think it's because we're not willing to engage ourselves with a process and reconciliation.
In South Africa, people were understood that they could not overcome racial segregation without a commitment to the truth and reconciliation.
In Rwanda, even before the genocide had this commitment, but in this country we haven't done it.
I was in Germany starting to talk about death.
It was fascinating because one of the teachers stood after my presentation and said, "You know it's good disturbing to listen to what they <unk>
<unk> We don't have death death in Germany.
We will never be able to get it here."
The room was silent and a lady said, "There's no way that with our story, we could never get into the systematic death of human beings.
It would be irrational that we <unk> and <unk> and <unk> we would run the people."
<unk> about this.
How would we feel like a world where a nation like Germany, <unk> people, especially if they were in most <unk>
We couldn't get it to it.
It would be irrational.
And yet, there is this disconnection.
I think our identity is in danger.
If you don't really care about these real issues, the positive and wonderful things are, however, <unk>
We love innovation.
We are fascinated by technology. <unk> creativity.
We love entertainment.
But lately, those realities are <unk> by suffering, abuse, the <unk> the <unk>
In my view, you need to integrate both of them.
And lately we talked about the need to have more hope, more commitment, more commitment to the basic challenges of this complex world.
I think that is going to be more time thinking about and talking about the poor, <unk> that you never get to TED.
And if you think about them it is, in a way, something that is within our self.
It's true that we need to believe in issues that we haven't seen.
So we are. Despite being as rational as committed to the intellectual <unk>
And in innovation, the development comes out not just from brain ideas.
These things come from ideas that come from ideas, also by the convictions of the heart.
This is the connection of the mind with the heart of the heart that drives us to look at not just the bright and <unk> but also the hard thing to look at it.
<unk> <unk> the great <unk> leader talked about this.
He said, "When we were in East Europe suffering from the <unk> we wanted all sorts of things, but mainly what we needed was hope, orientation for spirit, a will for being in places of despair and being <unk>
Well, that orientation for the spirit is pretty much at the heart of what I think, is even in communities like TED, it must be <unk>
There is no disconnect related to technology and design, which allows us to truly be humans if we don't pay attention to poverty, the <unk> to inequality, injustice.
Now I want to argue that these thoughts make a much more challenging identity than if we were ignoring these things.
We go back to <unk>
I had the great privilege, being a very young lawyer -- to meet Rosa <unk>
These women were getting together just to speak.
Occasionally, the lady was called, to say, <unk> comes the lady <unk> We're going to come together to speak.
You want to come and <unk>
I said, "I know lady. I do."
So she said, "Well, what are you going to do when you <unk>
I read <unk>
So I went and just <unk>
It was very <unk> very <unk>
And on one occasion I was there, listening to these <unk> and after a couple of hours, Ms. Parks came to me and said, "Now, what is it that idea of justice <unk>
Tell me what you're trying to do."
And I started to give my speech.
I said, "Well, we're trying to question injustice.
We try to help those who have been doomed to be killed.
We tried to confront prejudice and discrimination in the administration of criminal justice.
We try to end up with the sentences of life, without freedom for the kids.
We try to do something about the death penalty thing.
We try to reduce the population in prisons.
We try to end up with the <unk> <unk>
I gave it all my best speech, and at the end of the end and he looked at me and said, <unk> <unk> <unk>
And <unk> <unk> very <unk>
At that moment, Mrs. <unk> got me <unk> he put my finger on the face and said, "This is why you have to be very <unk>
I think actually, the TED community has to be much more <unk>
We need to find the way to deal with those challenges, those problems, that suffering.
Because finally humanity depends on compassion for others.
I've learned some very simple things in my work.
I've been <unk> in simple things.
I've come to understand and to believe that each one of us is higher to the worst that we have <unk>
I think that's true for everybody on the planet.
I'm convinced that if someone says a lie, it's not because it's a liar.
I'm sure if someone takes something that doesn't <unk> it's not a <unk>
Even if someone kills another one, it's not a <unk>
So I think there's a basic dignity in the people who must be <unk> by the law.
I also believe that in many parts of this country, and certainly in many parts of the world, the opposite of poverty is not wealth.
That's right.
I really think that in a lot of the opposite of poverty is justice.
And finally, I think that even though it is very beautiful, very beautiful, very <unk> very <unk> we're not judge by our technology, for our designs, for our intellectual and rational.
At the end, the character of a society, not by the way they treat the rich and powerful rich and <unk> but by the way they treat the poor, the <unk> the prisoners.
Because it's in this context as we start to understand truly profound issues about what we are.
Sometimes I feel <unk> I'm going to end with a story.
Sometimes I do too much force.
<unk> tired, like everybody.
Sometimes those ideas go beyond my <unk> in a major way.
I've been representing these guys who have been <unk> with a lot of <unk>
I'm going to go to prison and I see my customers of 13 and 14 years old, who have been <unk> so that they would become like adults like adults.
And I start thinking, how can it be?
How can a judge turn someone into what is not it?
The judge <unk> it as an adult, but I see a child.
One night late I was awake at God, if the judge can turn you into something that you don't have, you must have magical powers.
Yes, <unk> the judge has magical powers.
You should ask for some of that.
As it was too late, I couldn't think right, but I started working on a <unk>
I had a <unk> customer -- a little, black poor, black.
I started working on the <unk> with a <unk> who said, <unk> so that my <unk> black client is treated as a <unk> white <unk> of a <unk>
In the <unk> I found that there were been <unk> behavior in the <unk> in the behavior of the police and in the process.
There was a <unk> line about how in this country there is no ethics, but a whole lack of ethics.
At the next morning, I woke up thinking that <unk> <unk> would be a dream, or really <unk>
For my horror, not only had it, but he had sent it to court.
It took about two months, I had forgotten it.
And finally <unk> Oh God, I have to go to court for this case, stupid.
I got into the car and I felt really <unk> <unk>
I was in the car to court.
I thought this would be very difficult and <unk>
I finally came down from the car. She walks to court.
I was climbing the stairs when I met a black man -- was the <unk> of the court.
When he saw me, he came up to me and said, "Who are you?"
I said, "I'm a <unk> He said, "It's you <unk> I said yes.
Then I went up and <unk>
And I got into the ear, on the ear.
He said, "I'm proud of <unk>
I have to tell you now that that was <unk>
That was deeply connected to my interior, with my identity with the ability that we all have to contribute to the community with a sense of hope.
Well, I went into the audiences.
When the judge came in, the judge saw me.
And he said, "Mr. Stevenson, you wrote this bold <unk>
I said, "I know Mr. <unk> me." And we started going.
People started there. They were all <unk>
I was the one who had written those <unk>
They got the police cops who are <unk> the <unk>
Suddenly, I didn't know how, the room was full of people, because we were talking about races, because we talked about poverty, because we were talking about inequality.
With the <unk> of the eye, I had to see the <unk> which was going to be and <unk>
I would look down the window and <unk> to hear all that <unk>
<unk> walking over here and there.
Finally, this old old <unk> face entered the room and sat behind me, almost on the table of lawyers.
A few minutes later, Justice <unk> <unk>
During the break of a <unk> I showed you upset because the <unk> had entered in the room.
He ran over the old black <unk>
He said, <unk> what do you do in the <unk>
And the old black stood up, looked at me and he looked at me and he said, "Tell this <unk> room to tell this young man who keeps his view in the target with <unk>
I have come today at TED because I think many of you understand that the moral bow of the universe is very big, but it folds into justice.
We can't really be <unk> if we don't care about human rights and for dignity.
That our survival is linked to each other.
That our visions of technology, design, entertainment and creativity must be <unk> at <unk> <unk> and justice.
And above all, those of you who share this, I just want to tell you that keep the view in the goal with <unk>
Thank you very much.
Chris Anderson: <unk> to hear and see an obvious desire for the audience, of this community, to help you do something.
Something that isn't a check. What can we do?
<unk> There's a number of opportunities close to you.
If you live in the state of California, for example, there will be a <unk> this spring in which a <unk> effort is going to be done to <unk> the funds that are spent today in political policy.
For example, here in California, you're going to spend a billion dollars at death penalty in the next five years, a billion dollars.
And despite this, the <unk> of the murder cases, not <unk> in <unk>
<unk> <unk> don't get anything.
Here's an opportunity for change.
This <unk> is going to come up with these funds to make the law, to security.
I think there's a very close opportunity.
CA: There have been a huge decline in <unk> in the United States, in the last three decades.
Part of the explanation, it says it has to do with the highest rate of <unk>
What would you say to what you think is that?
<unk> Actually the rate of <unk> with violence has remained relatively stable.
The big growth in <unk> in this country is not about crimes with violence.
It's because of the wrong war on drugs.
So this is why it turns out this dramatic increase in the population <unk>
And we let ourselves convince the rhetoric about punishment.
We have three legal causes to bring people into <unk> chain to steal a bicycle, by small crimes against property, instead of making them <unk> those resources to their victims.
I think we need to do more to help the victims of <unk> and not less.
It seems to me that our current philosophy about punishment does nothing for anybody.
I think that's the orientation that has to change.
CA: <unk> you've got to be excited about today.
You're very inspiring.
Thank you very much for having come to TED. Thank you.

Oh, my God!
Peter <unk> These are just some of the clips I got in the last six months, <unk> could be the last six days or the last six years.
The idea is that media media prefer <unk> negative news -- because our minds pay them attention.
And that responds to a very good reason.
In every second of each day our senses are getting many, many more data than probably the brain can be <unk>
And as nothing matters to us to survive, the first stop of all that data is an old piece of the temporal lobe called <unk>
The amygdala is our early warning detector.
<unk> and records all the information looking for something in the environment that could make us harm.
That's why a <unk> of stories, <unk> look at the negative.
That old adage of <unk> "If there's blood blood, you know, it's very true.
And because all digital devices give us negative news for the seven days of the week, 24 hours a day, not surprising to be <unk>
It's not surprising that people think the world is going to be worse.
But maybe it isn't.
Maybe instead, what really happens is we get <unk>
Perhaps huge progress done in the last century by a series of forces is <unk> so we have the potential to create a world of abundance in the next three decades.
I'm not saying that we don't have our good problems: the climate change, the scarcity of water and <unk> without doubt we have.
As human beings are very good at <unk> the problems and the long run, we just had them.
<unk> then what happened in the last century to see where we go.
In the last hundred years, the average of life has more than <unk> the average average per capita per capita of inflation has <unk> around the world.
The child mortality has reduced 10 times.
In addition, the cost of food, in transportation and communications, has fallen 10 to 1,000 times.
Steve <unk> showed us that we're living the most peaceful time in human history.
And Charles <unk> that global literacy went from 25 to more than 80 percent in the last 130 years.
We're really living an extraordinary time.
A lot of people have done it.
And we continue to <unk> more and higher expectations.
In fact, <unk> the meaning of poverty.
<unk> today in America, a lot of the people who live under the poverty line have electricity, water, toilets, refrigerators TV, mobile and cars.
The <unk> <unk> of the last century, the <unk> of the planet, would never have dreamed of such <unk>
And so much of this is the technology and it involves exponential growth.
My good friend Ray Kurzweil showed that any tool that <unk> in technology of information jumps into this curve, Moore's Law, and double the price of price in about 12 to 24 months.
So the mobile phone that you have in your pocket is a million times cheaper and a thousand times faster than a supercomputer for the '70s.
Now look at this curve.
It's Moore's Law for the last hundred years.
I want you to look at two things in this curve.
First, how soft is -- in good and bad days, in the war and peace, in recession and <unk>
It's the resulting end of computers used to build faster computers.
It doesn't stop any of the big challenges.
And even though it's <unk> in a law on the left, it goes up to the top.
The growth rate of technology is more and faster.
And in this curve, to <unk> by Moore's Law, there's a series of extraordinarily powerful technologies that we have.
<unk> in the cloud, that my friends of <unk> call infinite computing and the networks, the 3D printing and their ability to democratize and distribute personalized production across the planet, synthetic biology, fuels and food, digital, digital, <unk> and <unk>
I mean, how many of you saw the victory of Watson, <unk>
It was <unk>
I looked at the newspapers the best headline than <unk>
And I loved this: <unk> <unk> <unk>
"Jeopardy" is not a easy game.
It plays with the <unk> of human language.
Imagine this artificial intelligence in the cloud, available to all of the mobile phone.
Four years ago here at TED, Ray Kurzweil and I, we launched a new college called <unk> <unk>
We teach these technologies to our students, and in particular, how can we be used to solve the great challenges of humanity.
And every year we asked them to release a company, or a product or service, that can affect the lives of a billion people in a decade.
Think about that, the fact that a group of students today can impact the life of a billion people.
Thirty years ago, I would have <unk> absurd.
Today we can point out a <unk> of companies that have already done.
When I think about creating abundance, it doesn't mean to create <unk> life for each <unk> is about creating a life of possible.
It's about taking that thing that is scarce and making it <unk>
You see, scarcity is <unk> and technology is a force that releases resources.
Let me give you an example.
It's a story of Napoleon <unk> in the <unk>
He's the guy on the left.
<unk> the king of <unk>
The troops of Napoleon ate with silver, and the same <unk> with <unk>
But the king of <unk> ate with aluminum.
You see, the aluminum metal was the most valuable metal in Earth, was worth more than the gold and the <unk>
For that reason, the tip of the Washington state of aluminum.
You see, even though the aluminum is the <unk> of the Earth of the Earth, it doesn't come like <unk>
It's tied up for oxygen and <unk>
But then the <unk> came up and made the aluminum thing so cheap that we use it as if it was <unk>
<unk> this analogy to the future.
Let's think about energy control.
Ladies and gentlemen, we are on a planet -- we're going to run by 5,000 times more energy than we use in a year.
They come to Earth 16 percent of energy every 88 minutes.
It's not about scarcity, it's about <unk>
And there's good news.
This year, for the first time, the cost of solar power in India is 50 percent less than the generated by <unk> <unk> rupees versus 17 rupees.
The cost of solar energy fell 50 percent last year.
Last month, the MIT published a study that shows that at the end of the decade, in the United States, the solar electricity will cost six cents an hour compared to the 15 cents of the national average.
And if we have abundance of energy we have an abundance of water.
Let's talk about wars in the water.
Do you remember when Carl Sagan pointed the Voyager Voyager towards the Earth, in 1990, after I spent <unk>
<unk> a famous photo, how do you <unk>
"A <unk> <unk> <unk>
Because we live on a planet of water.
We live on a planet covered in 70 percent.
Yes, <unk> water is saltwater, two percent of the ice is ice, and we fought the <unk> of the planet, but there is a hope.
It's a technology available for 10 or 20 years, but right now.
It comes the nanotechnology, the <unk>
In a conversation with Dean Kamen this morning, one of the innovators in the <unk> I would like to share with you, gave me permission to <unk> his technology called <unk> <unk> the <unk> is the size of a small refrigerator.
It is able to generate a thousand liters of drinking water to the day of any source -- saltwater, <unk> water -- at least two cents a gallon.
The president of Coca-Cola just assumed that I'm going to make a major test of hundreds of these units in the developing world.
If that comes out well, and I have full confidence that we will be, Coca-Cola is going to be <unk> in <unk> countries on the planet.
This is a <unk> innovation.
And we've seen it in mobile phones.
My God, we're going to get to 70 percent penetration in the mobile world in the end of 2013.
<unk> that Lakota warrior has better mobile communications in Kenya that President Reagan is 25 years ago.
And to tell you with a smart cell with Google, has access to more knowledge and information than President Clinton does 15 years ago.
She lives in a world of abundance of information and communications that no one could ever have been.
better than that, the things that you and I have paid for you for dozens and hundreds of thousands of dollars -- video <unk> images, <unk> <unk> images, <unk> technology and music, technology -- <unk> <unk> and lose market value with mobile phones.
Maybe the best comes up when it comes to the health applications.
Last month, I had the pleasure of announce with the <unk> Foundation, which is called the <unk> X <unk> <unk>
We are challenging the teams of the world so that we have these technologies in a mobile device with which they speak, and because it has <unk> they can be able to be extracted from your finger.
To win it has to make better diagnoses than a medical medical team.
Imagine this device in the middle of the developing world where there are no doctors, where the burden of <unk> is 25 percent of the health care workers.
When this device <unk> a RNA virus or DNA that will not be able to call the health <unk> and first of all, avoiding the pandemic.
But this is the largest force to produce a world of abundance.
I call it the billion increase.
The white lines here are the population.
We just had a brand of the seven billion.
By the way, the best protection against population explosion is to give the world of education and health.
In 2010, we had less than two billion people online, that are connected.
By 2020, spending from two billion to five billion users of the Internet.
Three billion minds have never been <unk> to the global conversation.
What will these people?
What do you do? What wishes to <unk>
And instead of economic collapse we'll have the largest economic injection of history.
These people represent tens of trillion dollars <unk> in global economy.
And <unk> from more health thanks to the <unk> of a better education with the Khan Academy and because of the using 3D Academy and computing in the cloud will be more productive than ever before.
What can you provide three billion more members of human humanity, healthy and <unk>
How about voices never before <unk>
What if we give the oppressed, wherever they are, a voice to be heard and be able to act for the first time?
What would you find? These three billion?
And if they're contributions that we can't afford to.
One thing that I learned with the X Prize, is that small teams that are small, guided by his passion with a goal of course, can do things that were <unk> things that could only make great corporations and governments.
I'm going to end up sharing a story that really bothers me.
There's a program that maybe some of you know.
It's called <unk>
<unk> at the University of Washington in Seattle.
It's a game where people can take a sequence of amino acids and figure out how to fold the protein.
<unk> determine the structure and functionality.
It's a very important thing in medical research.
And so far, it was a problem of <unk>
They've played with this university teachers among others.
Then hundreds of thousands of people joined and started <unk>
And it's shown that today the machinery of human patterns is better by folding proteins than the best computers.
Ladies and gentlemen, what gives me a huge confidence in the future is that we have more power to take the big challenges on the planet.
We have the tools with this exponential technology.
We have the <unk> passion of <unk>
We have the capital of the <unk>
And we have three billion new minds that are going to get us to work on the solution of big challenges and do what we should do.
We have a few extraordinary decades here.
Thank you.
I'm going to talk about a very <unk> idea.
<unk> of the point of <unk>
And as the idea can be explained in a minute, before I give you three examples to do time.
The first story is about Charles Darwin, one of my heroes.
He was here, as you know, in <unk>
Maybe they believed that <unk> <unk> it wasn't like that.
They actually <unk> fish.
And he described one of them as very <unk>
It was the <unk>
He caught it a lot to the decade of <unk>
Now the fish are in the Red Cross in the <unk>
But we've heard this story a lot of times, about Galapagos and other places, so that doesn't have anything special.
But the case is that we still come to the Galapagos.
We still think they're <unk>
The brochures still say they're still <unk>
So what happens here?
The second story, also illustrates another concept of the waist.
Because I was there in <unk> studying one water in West Africa.
I was there because I grew up in Europe and then I wanted to work in Africa.
I thought I could <unk>
I burned a lot with the sun and I was convinced that I was not there.
This is my first exposure to the sun.
The water was surrounded by <unk> and, as you can see, from a few <unk>
There were <unk> of about 20 p.m., the black beard <unk>
And the fishery of this <unk> was very abundant and spent for a good moment, so it was made more than the average in Ghana.
When I went there 27 years later, the number of fish had dropped in half.
I went back to the five inches of <unk>
They have a genetic pressure.
There were still fish.
In a way, they were still happy.
And the fish were still happy to be there.
I mean, nothing to changed, but everything has changed.
My third story is that I was complicit in the introduction of <unk> in Southeast Asia.
In the 1970s <unk> <unk> started in <unk> Europe did a lot of development projects.
The fishing development was supposed to impose to the countries that were already 100,000 <unk> <unk> industrial fishing.
And this boat, quite <unk> he called the <unk> four.
I went out to fish in it, and we did studies in the South Sea of China in the South China, and above all, in the Sea Sea.
What we captured there was something <unk>
<unk> I now know, the bottom of the sea.
Ninety percent of what we captured were <unk> other animals that are on the bottom.
And most of the fish are blobs of tiny <unk> about <unk> remains that are a coral reef.
In short, the bottom of the sea came in the deck and then it was <unk>
These images are extraordinary because the transition is very fast.
In a year, you do a study and then the commercial fishing begins.
The background happens to be a solid coral background in this case, to be a <unk>
This is a dead <unk>
They didn't get them. They were dead because they were dead.
Once we captured a alive.
I wasn't still <unk>
So they wanted to <unk> because it was a good food.
This mountain of remains of the remains that the fishermen go to an area where they never have fish.
But there's no <unk>
We don't remember it.
You know, the starting point of start to start at the new level, without remembering what was there.
If you look at this something like this.
On the axis here, we have <unk> biodiversity, a lot of <unk> the <unk> of the country, the water supply.
And that changes over time. It changes because people do things with <unk>
Each generation will use the <unk> images at the beginning of their conscious life as normal and extrapolate forward.
The difference is that they perceive loss.
But they don't perceive the loss that happened before.
You can look at this kind of changes.
And at the end of the end, keeping a few <unk>
And that, in great extent, we want to do it now.
We want to keep things that are no longer they are, or they're not what they were.
But you should think that this problem is affecting people when societies have killing animals without knowing what they've done to some generations later.
Because of course, an animal that is very plentiful, before <unk> is <unk>
You don't lose <unk> animals.
You lose some common animals.
Even if this is not perceived as a great loss.
Over time, we focus on big animals, and in a sea synonymous with big fish.
They become <unk> because <unk>
Over time there are a few fish, but we think that's the point of <unk>
And the question is, why do we accept this?
Well, because we don't know it was different.
In fact, a lot of people, scientists, <unk> that was very different.
And they will do it because the evidence presented in a previous way, is not the way they would expect that the evidence.
For example, the anecdote that some <unk> as he looked at such a lot of fish in this area you can't be able to be used or generally they don't use the <unk> scientists because it's not <unk>
So we have a situation where people don't know the past, even though we lived in <unk> societies because they don't rely on the sources of the past.
From there the huge role that it can fulfill a protected area.
Because with the marine zones -- we really visualize the past.
And then we were able to figure out the past that people can't conceive of because the starting point has run over, and it's extremely low.
That's for the people that you can see a protected marine zone, and they can benefit from the vision that <unk> which allows them to erase their <unk>
And what about people who can't do it because they have no access, like people in the Middle West, for example?
I think that the arts and cinema may be able to fill the vacuum. The simulation.
This is a simulation of the Bay Bay.
A long time ago, there were gray whales in the <unk> Bay Bay
And you have noticed that <unk> and <unk> are like <unk>
And if you think about <unk> if you think about why people were moved with the movie <unk> to talk about the story of <unk> why do we deal with <unk>
Because it raises something that in a sense, has been lost.
So my <unk> the only one that to give, is Mahmoud -- <unk> <unk> underwater.
Thank you very much.
Hello. I'm Kevin <unk> the <unk> manager of <unk> and I look at YouTube YouTube videos.
It's true.
That's why we're going to see why the videos get viral and how important it is.
We all want to be <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> When I was younger, that seemed something very, very difficult.
But today, the web video makes any of us, or our actions, copper in a part of our global culture.
Anyone can get famous on the Internet in a <unk>
They go up over 48 hours of YouTube for minute.
And of those, just a small percentage of these, you get lots and lots of visits and make a cultural <unk>
How does that happen?
Three things: creators of trends, and surprise.
Okay, <unk>
<unk> <unk> Oh, my God, my God.
Oh my God!
Wow.
<unk> <unk>
KA: Last year, <unk> <unk> published this video shot outside his house in the National Park <unk>
In 2010, it was 23 million times.
This graph shows the views in the rise of the southern summer of summer summer.
<unk> I didn't talk to do a viral video.
I just wanted to share a double rainbow ...
That's what you do if it's called Mountain Mountain <unk>
There were a lot of videos of nature.
This video had been published in January.
So what happened here?
It was Jimmy <unk>
Jimmy <unk> published this fact that I went to the <unk>
<unk> of trends like Jimmy <unk> show us new and interesting things and <unk> to a wider audience.
Rebecca <unk>  It's Friday, a Friday. You have to start on a deck of week, the end of a week --   -- you want me to get the weekend on the front of the weekend.  KA: Don't think that we could have this conversation without talking about this video, I hope.
<unk> <unk> Black is one of the most popular videos of the year.
You saw it almost 200 million times this year.
This graph shows the frequency of use.
Just like <unk> <unk> this video seemed to have emerged from nowhere.
So what happened this day?
Well, it was Friday, it's true.
And if you ask those other <unk> they're also Friday.
But what happened this day, this particular <unk>
Well, I took it to them, and a lot of blogs started writing about it.
Michael J. <unk> from <unk> Science <unk> was one of the first people in making a joke on Twitter.
But what's important is that a person or a group of creators embrace a point of view and share it with a broader audience, accelerating the process.
So this community of people who shares this big joke and then start talking about that and doing things.
And now there are 10,000 <unk> <unk> on YouTube.
Just in the first seven days, there was a parody of each other day.
Unlike the <unk> entertainment entertainment of the 20th century, this communal engagement is our way of being part of the <unk> or doing something new with <unk>
<unk> <unk> is an <unk> animation with a <unk> music.
That's it. That's it.
This year saw him about 50 million times.
And if you think that's weird, you know there's a version of three hours that has been seen four million times.
Until cats saw this video.
And there are cats who saw other cats to see the video.
But what's important here is creativity that woke up between the Internet <unk> community.
There was <unk>
Someone made an version to the old version.
And then it became international.
Suddenly, a whole community of <unk> that made this happen from being a stupid joke to something that we all can be involved in.
Because today not just <unk> <unk>
Who could have predicted something like this?
Who could have predicted <unk> <unk> <unk> or RS: Black or <unk> <unk>
What script could have been written to be written by this situation?
In a world where you go up two days of video for minute, just that really unexpected and unexpected can be able to figure out how these things have done.
When a friend told me I had to see this great video of a kind that protest against <unk> <unk> in New York, I admit, I didn't get interested in too much.
Casey <unk> I was <unk> by <unk> but often there are obstacles that prevent you properly through the <unk>
KA: Thanks to the surprise effect, and your humor, Casey <unk> managed to get five million to see and understand their idea.
So this approach is worth everything we do in a creative way.
And all of this leads to a big question.
<unk> <unk> What does this mean?
<unk>
KA: What does this mean?
<unk> communities, creative communities of participation, totally unexpected, are features of a new kind of media, from a new culture, that we all have access to and is the audience that defines the popular.
As I said earlier, one of the current celebrities of the world, Justin <unk> started on YouTube.
I don't have permission to express their ideas.
Now we're all a little masters of our pop culture.
These are not the characteristics of old media -- it's just the current media, but they are <unk> the entertainment media.
Thank you.
This is not a <unk> story.
It's a puzzle that's still <unk>
Let me tell you about some of the pieces.
Imagine the first <unk> a man burning the work of a whole life.
It's a poet, a <unk> a man whose entire life had been supported by the only unit and freedom of their country.
<unk> while <unk> go into <unk> <unk> the fact that their life had been totally in vain.
The words for so long, friends, now I would get it.
They were <unk> in silence.
He died broken for the story.
He's my grandfather.
I never met him.
But our lives are much more than our memories.
My grandmother would never let me forget his story.
My job was not to let that have been in <unk> and my lesson was to learn that the story was trying to figure out, but I was <unk>
The next part of the puzzle is about a boat at dawn <unk> <unk> to the sea.
My mother, <unk> was only 18 years old, when his father died, and a <unk> marriage and two little girls.
For her, life had been destined for a <unk> task for his family and a new life in Australia.
It was <unk> for her who couldn't do it.
And after a <unk> of four years that defies fiction, a boat goes down to the sea dressed from ship <unk>
All adults knew the risks.
The greatest fear was <unk> the rape and death.
Like most adults, my mother was carrying a <unk> with poison.
If we asked ourselves, first we would take it my sister and I, and then she and my grandmother.
My first memories are from that boat, the constant rhythm of the engine, the <unk> <unk> on each wave, and the skyline and empty around.
I don't remember hackers who came several times, but they were <unk> with the bravery of men in our boat, or the engine dying and not being able to catch for six hours.
But I do remember the lights of the oil platform in front of the coast of Malaysia, and the young man who collapsed and died, and finish the journey was too much for it, and the first apple I did, because of the men on the platform.
No apple had the same flavor.
After three months in a refugee camp, <unk> in <unk>
And the next piece of the puzzle is about four women across three generations giving way to a new life together.
We set up in <unk> a suburb of kind of <unk> class whose population is comprised of immigrants from pigs.
Unlike the <unk> suburbs whose existence was <unk> in <unk> no sense of the right.
The smells that came from the stores were the rest of the world.
And the <unk> English fragments were <unk> between the people who had one thing in common: they were starting again.
My mother worked in farms, then in a car assembly line, working six days, double shift.
Yet, I found time to study English and get a title in I.T. IT from the <unk>
We were poor.
All the dollars were <unk> and established an extra mentoring in English and mathematics, you wouldn't mind what it was supposed to be, which was usually clothes <unk> it was always <unk>
Two <unk> pairs for school, one to hide holes from the other.
A uniform uniform to the <unk> because I had to last six years.
And there were <unk> and <unk> on the <unk> <unk> and some <unk> <unk> back again.
At home, where?
Something in me is <unk>
I was accumulating determination and a voice that said, "I'm going to <unk>
My mother, my sister and I <unk> in the same bed.
My mother was <unk> every night, but we were <unk> on our day and <unk> the movements of our grandmother at the home.
My mother had <unk> all of the ship.
And my task was to be awake until your nightmares was they started to be able to <unk>
She opened a computer store, then I studied to be <unk> and it opened another business.
And women would come with their stories about men who couldn't make the transition angry and <unk> and <unk> children caught in between two worlds.
They looked for subsidies and <unk>
And they created centers.
I lived in parallel.
In one, it was the classic <unk> student with what I think of myself.
On the other, I was <unk> in <unk> lives, tragically <unk> by violence, abuse of drugs and isolation.
But many of them got help over the years.
And for that work, when I was studying my last year of a lawyer, I chose the young Australian man from the year.
And I was <unk> from a piece of the puzzle to the other, but its edges, but not <unk>
So <unk> resident <unk> was now as <unk> refugee and social activist invited to talk about sites that I never heard of, and in houses whose existence would never have imagined.
I didn't know the <unk>
I didn't know how to use <unk>
I didn't know how to talk about wine.
I didn't know how to talk about anything.
I wanted to retreat into <unk> and the comfort of life in a suburb <unk> -- a grandmother, a mother and two daughters end the day as they did for almost 20 years, <unk> on the day of every day and <unk> <unk> the three still bed.
And I told my mom I couldn't do it.
And I reminded me that I was right now the same age that she had when she ran into the ship.
That didn't have been an option.
<unk> he said to me, and you don't be what you don't know.
So I talked about <unk> youth and education and <unk> to the marginalized and the <unk>
And the more frankly I was talking, more it was <unk> to speak.
I met people from all the paths of life, many of them doing what they were going to live on the border of possible.
And even though I ended up my <unk> I realized I couldn't stay in a <unk> race.
I had to have another piece of the puzzle.
And I realized at the same time that it's okay to be an unknown, new arrive at the scene -- and not just that it's good, but it's something that will be grateful, maybe a ship.
Because being inside it can easily mean <unk> <unk> can easily mean to accept the assumptions of your <unk>
I gave the enough steps out of my comfort zone to know that, yes, the world will be <unk> but not the way we fear.
<unk> that wouldn't have been <unk> they were <unk> tremendously.
There was an energy there, a <unk> optimism -- a rare <unk> and <unk>
So I followed my intuition.
So let's give a small group of people for those who are <unk> <unk> <unk> was a <unk> challenge.
For a year we didn't have a <unk>
At the end of every day, he was doing a giant soup pot that all <unk>
<unk> up to the night.
Most of our ideas were <unk> but some bright and open step.
I took the decision to move to the U.S.
After a single trip.
My <unk> again.
Three months later, I had <unk> and the adventure <unk>
Before I finish, let me tell you about my grandmother.
She grew up in a time when the <unk> was social norm and the local <unk> was the person who cared.
Life had not changed for centuries.
His father died shortly after she was born.
The mother was raised alone.
The 17 became <unk> of a <unk> whose mother <unk>
No support of his husband, caused an <unk> to the <unk> and bring the cause itself, and much more <unk> caused when I won.
You can't have proven to be wrong.
I was in the shower in a hotel room at <unk> when she died, to 3,000 miles in <unk>
I looked through the <unk> of the shower and I saw it standing on the other side.
I knew I'd come to <unk>
My mother called minutes later.
Days later, we went to a Buddhist temple in <unk> and we sat around with her <unk>
We tell the stories and make sure that we were still with it.
On the night a monk came and told us that I had to close the <unk>
My mother asked us to turn his hand.
I asked her to <unk> "Why her hand is hot, and the rest of the body so <unk>
"Because you've taken your hand from the <unk> he said.
Have you not <unk>
If there's a nerve in our family, that runs through women.
Since we were and how life is built, we can now see that the men who have come to our lives would have been <unk>
<unk> would be very easily.
Now I want to have my own kids, and I wonder about the ship.
Who could want that to know?
However, I fear the privilege of the easy thing.
Can I give you a <unk> in your lives, a brave <unk> in each wave, the constant rhythm of the engine, the vast horizon that don't guarantee anything?
I don't know.
But if I could take it and see them safe I would do it.
<unk> <unk> and also the mother of which is now here, in the fourth or fifth row.
My story begins in <unk> about two years ago.
I was in the desert, under the <unk> sky with the singer, <unk> <unk>
We were having a conversation about how nothing has changed since the age of the ancient Indian <unk> "The <unk>
In those days when the Indians wanted to travel <unk> to a car and <unk> the sky.
Now we do it with airplanes.
At that time, when <unk> was the great Indian warrior -- he had <unk> he took a bow and with a <unk> onto the ground, she got water.
We now do the same with <unk> and machines.
The conclusion we took was that the machinery had replaced the magic.
And so I got a lot of <unk>
Every time I felt a little bit more <unk>
I was struck by this idea of losing the ability to enjoy and appreciate a sunset if I didn't have the camera, if I couldn't get my friends.
It seemed to me that the technology had to allow the magic -- not <unk>
As a girl my grandfather gave me his <unk> silver <unk>
And this piece of technological <unk> was for my most magical thing.
It became a golden door to a world full of images, <unk> and <unk> in my imagination.
I had a sense that mobile phones, the luxury clocks and the cameras prevent you <unk>
<unk> our inspiration.
And so I <unk> I threw up this technological world to see how to use it to create magic, instead of <unk>
<unk> books for the age of 16.
So when I saw the iPad, I saw a storytelling device able to connect the readers of the whole world.
You can know how to take the book.
where we are.
<unk> the text with the image, the animation, sound and touch.
<unk> becomes increasingly <unk>
But what does that do is that?
I'm about to launch <unk> an interactive app for iPad.
It says, "You get your fingers on every light."
And so ...  He says, "This box is <unk> I write my name.
And so I get a character from the book.
In many times, I get a <unk> -- the iPad knows where I live through GPS -- that comes to me.
My little little little girl is excited about all these possibilities.
I've talked a lot about magic.
And I don't mean wizards and <unk> but to that magic of childhood, to those ideas that we were coming from children.
For some reason, fireflies in a jar always became a little bit of exciting.
So here, we have to tilt the iPad to release fireflies.
And actually light your way into what subtraction of the book.
Another idea that I was fascinated by a little girl was that a whole galaxy in a <unk>
So here, every book and every world becomes a <unk> that I move into this magical device inside the device.
And this opens a map.
In all there in fantasy there has always been maps, but it's static maps.
This is a map that grows, <unk> and guide you through the rest of the book.
In certain points of the book also <unk>
I'm going to go in.
Another extremely important aspect of me is to create Indian content and contemporary and contemporary content.
These are the <unk>
We've all heard of fairies and <unk> but how many people out of India know their counterparts <unk> the <unk>
These poor <unk> have been trapped in the Indra of Indra for millennia, in an old and <unk>
So we're bringing them back into a children's story.
In a story that deals with current issues like environmental crisis.
And talking about the environmental crisis, one of the problems in the last 10 years has been that children have been <unk> attached to their <unk> they haven't left the outside world.
But now with mobile technology, we can bring our children into the natural world with their technology.
One of the interactions of the book is this adventure where you have to go out the outside, take the camera or iPad, and we collect images of different natural objects.
As a child, I had a lot of <unk> rocks and <unk> and <unk>
For some reason, children don't do it.
So to recover this childhood ritual you have to go out and in a chapter, which is a picture of a flower and then <unk>
In another chapter, you have to take a picture of a piece of cortex and then <unk>
So it creates a digital collection of photos that then you can put on the Web.
A kid in London puts a picture of a <unk> and he says, "Oh, I saw a <unk>
A kid in India says, "I saw a <unk>
And it creates this kind of social network around a collection of digital pictures that have been taking.
Inside the connection of connection between magic, Earth and technology are many possibilities.
In the next book, we have an interaction where you go on with the iPad and the video on this video on and it turned out and augmented reality to see a group of <unk> <unk> on the inner house.
On a moment the screen is full of leaves with leaves there.
And you have to make the sound of the wind and <unk> to be able to read the rest of the book.
We're going to go into a world where the forces of nature is going on with technology and magic and the technology and the technology is coming to each other.
It <unk> the power of the sun.
We're moving to our children and ourselves in the natural world and that magic, joy and child love that we sit through a simple story.
Thank you.
I'd like to talk to you about why many projects of <unk> <unk>
And I think, really, the most important thing about that is that we stop listening to patients.
And one of the things that we did at the University was <unk> to a director of the listening.
And not in a very scientific way, she raised a little cup of coffee or tea and asked patients, family and <unk> <unk>
"How can we <unk>
And we tend to think, that this is one of the biggest problems for what all of all, or perhaps not all, but most of the projects of <unk> fail, we just stop listening.
This is my Wi-Fi scale. It's a very simple thing.
It has a doorknob of <unk> and closed.
Every morning I was shocked.
And yes, I have a challenge as you can see.
I put my challenge to 95 percent.
But it's so simple, that every time I <unk> sends my information to Google <unk>
And my doctor of <unk> has access to him as well. So he can see what my weight problem, not at the same time when I need <unk> or any urgency of that style, but to see it backwards.
But there's another thing.
Like some of you know, I have more than 4,000 followers on Twitter.
So every morning I connect to my Wi-Fi scale and before I get to my car, people start to <unk> <unk> today I think you need a <unk>
That's the best thing that can happen, because it's pressure of pairs used to help patients, because it could be used for obesity, and also for patients to stop smoking.
On the other hand, it can be able to move people from their chairs and together to develop some <unk> activity to have more control of your health.
From next week to be available from the next week.
This little <unk> connected to an iPhone or another device.
And people are moving from their homes, taking their blood pressure, <unk> to their doctor, and share with others, for example, for 100 dollars.
This is the point where patients assume a position, they come back to recover control and being captains of their own <unk> but it can also help us care of health care because of the challenges that we face, as the firing costs of the costs of attention to the <unk> of demand and other issues.
<unk> techniques that are simple to use and start with this to engage the patients in the team.
And you can do it with techniques like this, but also by <unk>
And one of the things that we did like to share with you with a video with you.
We all have checks on the <unk>
Maybe we even have our cell phones.
We know where the <unk> ATM are in <unk>
Where are all the <unk>
And of course, we can find fast food.
But where is the closest <unk> to help this patient?
We asked it, but no one <unk>
Nobody knew where to get the <unk> saves lives right now.
What we did was do <unk> in the Netherlands.
We created a website, and we asked the public <unk> you see a <unk> for please <unk> where, when it's open, because sometimes you open up in <unk> and others are closed.
And more than 10,000 <unk> were introduced in the Netherlands.
The next step was to look for the application for that.
And we made an app for the iPad.
We created an app for <unk> reality to find these <unk>
And every time they are in the city of <unk> and someone <unk> you can use your iPhone, and to the next few weeks to use your cell phone cell to find the nearest <unk> which can save lives.
And from today, I'd like to present this one, not just as <unk> <unk> which is the name of the product, but also as <unk>
And we want to take it globally.
We are <unk> all of the colleagues in the world, at other universities, to help us find and work as a center for the <unk> of <unk> around the world.
Every time you're out of vacation and someone <unk> can be a relative or someone in front of you, you can find it.
I also want to invite companies around the world who could help us to validate these <unk>
You could be messaging services, or people of <unk> for example, to see if the <unk> which is shown is still in its place.
Please wake up in this and not just improve health, but take control of it.
Thank you very much.
I'm here to share a picture of photography.
Or is it <unk> <unk>
Because, of course, are photographs that you can't take with your cameras.
My interest in the photograph was woke up with my first digital camera at 15 years.
He mixed with my previous passion for drawing, but it was a little bit different because when I use the camera the process was in planning.
And when you take a photograph with a camera the process ends up when the <unk> is <unk>
For me, photography had more to do with being in the right place, at the right time.
It seemed like anyone could do it.
So I wanted to create something different, a process that would start by press the <unk>
<unk> like this: a building on a very <unk> road machine.
But it has a unexpected.
And even though it keeps a level of <unk>
Or pictures like <unk> dark and colorful and <unk> but with the common aim of keeping the standard of the <unk>
And when I say electronics, I say <unk>
Because of course, it's not something that I can do, but I always want it to be captured in some way as photography.
<unk> where you will have to think about a moment to discover the trick.
It has more to do with capturing an idea that with capturing a moment.
But what is the trick that makes them look <unk>
Are the details or the <unk>
<unk> the light?
What creates the <unk>
Sometimes the illusion is perspective.
But at the end, it is about our way to interpret the world and how you can perceive on a <unk> surface.
It's actually not about whether it's realistic but what we think it's realistic.
So I think the foundations are very simple.
I see it as a puzzle of reality where we take different pieces of reality and put them together to create an alternative reality.
Let me show you a simple example.
Here we have three perfectly <unk> objects that we can all relate to the three-dimensional world.
But combined in a certain way you can create something that still seems to be <unk> as if there was there.
But at the same time, we know that it doesn't exist.
So let's move into the brain because the brain doesn't embrace the fact that it doesn't really make sense.
And I see the same process by combining the photographs.
It's actually to combine different <unk>
And the things that make a picture seem realistic I think they're the ones that are not even going to do the things that are around us in our daily lives.
But by combining pictures is very important to <unk> because otherwise something is going to be seen wrong.
So I would like to say that there are three simple rules that will continue to achieve realistic results.
As you can see, these images are not very special.
But <unk> can create something like this.
So the first rule is that the combination of photos must have the same perspective.
Secondly, the photos are <unk> you have to have the same kind of light.
And these two images meet these <unk> were taken to the same height and the same kind of light.
The third point is to make it impossible to tell the beginning and the end of the different images with a perfect continent.
It has to be impossible to see where the image.
This is another example.
You might think this is the image of a landscape and the bottom is <unk>
But this image is completely composed of photographs of different places.
And I think it's easier to create a place that you find it -- because you don't need to put the ideas that you have in your head.
But it requires a lot of planning.
And as I thought about this idea in the winter I knew I had several months to try to find the different locations for the pieces of the puzzle.
For example, the fish was captured on a fishing journey.
The shores are a different location.
The <unk> part was captured in a <unk>
And yes, I even made the house from the top of the island and it looks more <unk>
So to make a realistic outcome, I think it takes planning.
It always starts with a <unk> an idea.
Then you have to combine the different pictures.
And here every piece is very well <unk>
If you do a good job when you take the photos the result can be very beautiful and at the same time a <unk>
All the tools are there and the only frontier is our imagination.
Thank you.
I'm going to start showing a slide on technology, very boring.
Please if you can <unk>
It's a diagram that I took from a folder of mine.
I'm not interested in so much to show you the details but the general aspect of it.
It's about a analysis that we were doing about the power of <unk> <unk> versus the power of local area networks.
What's interesting about this is that this one, as many other we tend to see, is a kind of straight line on scale.
In other words, every step here represents an order of magnitude on the scale of performance.
I'm going to talk about technology with <unk> curves -- it's something new.
Here's something weird happening.
And that's what I'm going to talk about.
Please light up the lights.
<unk> more intensity because writing about paper.
Why do we <unk> technological curves on <unk> scales.
The answer is that if you draw it into a normal curve that, let's say, these are the years, or some unit of time, and this would be any measure of the technology that I want to <unk> the diagram would see something ridiculous.
It would be something like this.
It doesn't say a lot.
But if you take a example, for example, some other technology, like transportation, on a <unk> curve, it would be very <unk> we would see a straight line.
But if something like this, it gives a <unk> change.
If the technology of transportation has been as fast as <unk> last morning we could take a taxi and be in Tokyo in 30 seconds.
But it doesn't go to that rhythm.
There is no unprecedented in the history of technological development of a finite growth that every single advance orders of magnitude.
The question I want to make is -- looking at these <unk> <unk> we see that they don't keep forever.
It's not possible to sustain this change as fast as it goes.
We had one of two things.
Or is it going to become a typical curve like this until it comes out to something totally different, or maybe it will do something like this.
That's all that can happen.
I'm optimistic, so I think maybe something like this.
So now we would be in the middle of a transition.
In this line we're in a transition from what it used to be the world, to a new way.
So what I'm trying to ask, and ask myself, what is that new way you adopt the world?
What new state is the world?
The transition seems very, very confused if we're engaged in it.
I remember the future was happening in the year 2000 and people used to talk about what would happen in the year 2000.
This is a conference where people talk about the future, and we see that the future is still 2000.
That's all we see.
In other words, the future has been <unk> year after year, along my life.
But I think it's because we feel something is going on.
And we can feel a transformation.
And we know that it doesn't have a lot of sense to think about 30 or 50 years because everything will be so different to extrapolate what we're doing today doesn't make any sense.
So I want to talk to you about how it might be, how could that transition to <unk>
But to do that will have to talk a little bit about things that don't have a lot to do with technology and computer thinking.
Because I think the only way to understand it is taking distance and look at the long term.
The scale of time I would like to do that is the time of life on Earth.
I think this image makes sense if we look at it every billion years.
So we go back about a half thousand years ago when the Earth was a big <unk> rock with many chemicals that are going to go around them.
If we look at the way that we organized those chemicals we give us an idea of how things happened.
And I think there are theories to start understanding the origin with RNA. I'm going to tell you a simple version of this and that is that, at that moment, there was floating about <unk> oil with all kinds of chemical recipes inside it.
Some of those blobs of oil droplet had a particular combination of chemicals that made them set out the outside of the outside and the drops grew up.
And they started <unk>
In a sense, those were the <unk> cell forms, those oil <unk>
But those drops weren't alive, in the current sense, because every one of them contained a random recipe of chemicals.
And every time they <unk> <unk> a <unk> distribution of chemicals that are <unk>
So every single <unk> was a little different.
In fact, the drops that somehow are going to be better at the time of bringing chemical chemicals together, more <unk> and more chemicals and more <unk>
Mostly, they lived longer, they were more <unk>
It was a way of life, very simple chemistry, but things became interesting when these drops learned the trick of abstraction.
Somehow we don't really understand these <unk> they learned to store information.
They learned to save information, which was the recipe for the cell in a special chemical called DNA.
In other words, <unk> in this evolution without any sense, a writing system that allowed them to register what they were to be able to <unk>
The amazing thing is that that writing system seems to have remained stable since we've evolved two billion years ago.
Our recipe, our genes, they have exactly the same code, that same writing system.
In fact, every living is expressed with exactly the same set of letters and the same code.
And one of the things I did just by <unk> we can actually write things with this code.
Here I have a hundred <unk> of white dust that I try to hide the airport security.
But <unk> Tom this <unk> The code has the common letters that we used to use in this -- and I wrote my personal data on this piece of DNA and it would take it 10 to 22 times.
So if someone wants 100 million copies of my personal card -- I have a lot of <unk> in fact, for every person in the world and is here.
If it was a <unk> I would have put it in a virus, and it would have spread all over the room.
What was the next <unk>
Writing the DNA was an interesting step.
This made these cells really happy another billion years.
But then there was another big step of step in which things are going on, and it was that these cells started trading and communicate information to form in the cells.
I don't know if you know, but bacteria can exchange DNA.
So for example, we evolved antibiotic resistance.
Some bacteria found the way we avoid penicillin and <unk> to create their little DNA with other bacteria and now there's a lot of resistant to penicillin because bacteria communicate.
This communication has given place to make communities that, in a way, they were together in it, and set up a <unk>
From that way, or <unk> them together, or whether a community was very successful all the individuals in that community get more and more and they were <unk> by evolution.
And the inflection point occurred when these communities were approaching so much that, in fact, they came together and decided to write all the recipe from the community board in a chain of DNA.
The next interesting stage for life took another billion years.
And in that stage we have <unk> communities of many different types of cells working together as a single organism.
In fact, we are a <unk> community.
We have a lot of cells that don't act alone.
The skin cell doesn't serve without the heart, or the muscles or the brain, and so on.
So these communities evolved and produced more interesting levels than the cell phone, something we call a organism.
The next level happened within these communities.
These started <unk> information.
And to build very special structures that didn't do more than process information in community.
They're <unk> structures.
The neurons are the devices that process the information that those cell communities built.
In fact, they started <unk> within the community being responsible for <unk> to understand the information.
Those were the brains and the nervous system of those communities.
And that gave them an evolutionary advantage.
Because at that time as <unk> learning was confined to the duration of an organism, and not to the period of evolutionary time.
So one organism on, for example, learn how to eat some fruit because I knew and got sick the last time she ate it.
That could happen during the life of an organism that had previously built these data processing structures that have had learned for hundreds of thousands of years by the death of individuals who ate that fruit there.
And so the fact that the nervous system built up those information structures led enormously the evolutionary process.
Because evolution could now happen confined to an individual.
It could happen in time to learn.
But then, of course, individuals figured out the trick of communication.
So, for example, the most <unk> version we know is human language.
If we think about it, it's an incredible invention.
I have a very complicated idea of a very complicated idea of the head.
I'm here sitting here emitting a few <unk> and hopefully building a similar idea, <unk> and <unk> in their heads that saved some analogy with mine.
But we take something very complicated and turn it into sound, in sound, and we produce something very complicated in another brain.
That now allows us to start to work as a organism.
In fact, as humanity, we've started doing <unk>
We now go through periods of similar periods of <unk> organisms -- our <unk> methods and information processing.
For example, the invention of language was a little step in that direction.
The <unk> the computer tape -- the <unk> the <unk> and so on.
And that brings us into something much larger, faster and able to evolve more than we did before.
Now evolution can happen in history.
You saw the evolutionary <unk> of <unk> where it produced some evolution with the <unk> program before our eyes.
And now we've accelerated the scales of time again.
The first stages of the story that told you taken took a billion years each.
The next few stages, the nervous system took a few hundred million years.
The beyond, the language and so on, they took less than a million years.
And beyond, as the electronics, it seems to take a few decades.
The process is <unk> I guess <unk> is the right word to name something that accelerates your own pace of change.
The more it changes, the faster it does.
And I think that's what we look at this explosion of curve.
We see the process <unk>
But I make a life designing computers, and I know that the mechanisms that jobs for <unk> would not be possible without the recent technologies.
But now design objects of such complexity that would be impossible for me to be <unk>
I don't know that every transistor in that machine machine.
There are billions.
Instead of that, with the designers of <unk> <unk> we think of a level of abstraction, we put it into the machine, and the machine with that does something that didn't do it, it gets much further and faster than ever before.
In fact, sometimes spending methods that we don't even understand well.
A particularly interesting method I've been using <unk> is evolution itself.
And we put inside the machine an evolutionary process operating on the scale of the past.
And for example, in the most extreme cases, we can evolve a program from a random sequence of instructions.
We say, "Please computer, you can run a hundred million <unk> instructions on chance?
You could run these sequences of instructions at random, running all those programs, and take those who are more <unk> what we want to do?"
In other words, I define what I want.
Let's say I want to order numbers, to put a simple example.
So we found the programs that are more close to order to order numbers.
Of course, it's unlikely that some random sequences of instructions, <unk> numbers, so none of them made it.
But one, luckily, he could find two numbers in the right order.
And I said, <unk> could you take 10 percent of those random sequences that best did the <unk>
They would take those and <unk> the rest.
And now we <unk> the best <unk> the numbers.
And let's go back to <unk> following a process of analog to the <unk>
Let's take two programs, which <unk> children, who are <unk> <unk> and that the children will make the properties of these programs.
So we got a new generation of software programs that had a little more success.
And we say, "Please, repeat the <unk>
Let's get it again.
We have some mutations here.
And it tries to new and <unk> with another generation.
Well, every generation takes a few milliseconds.
So, I can do the equivalent of millions of years of evolution in a few minutes or in cases in a little few hours.
In the end, we end up with programs that draw numbers in very perfect way.
In fact, they're a lot more efficient programs than I could have written by hand.
If I look at those programs I can't tell you how they work.
I've tried to analyze them to see how they work.
It's dark programs, weird programs.
But they get the <unk>
In fact, I know, I have the security of the goal that they get in because they come from a lineage of hundreds of thousands of programs that were able to do it.
In fact, their lives depend on it.
Once I was going on a <unk> with <unk> <unk> and he takes a card and says, "Look at this.
It says, <unk> plane has hundreds of thousands of <unk> who work together to provide a <unk> flight, you don't feel <unk>
We know that engineering processes don't work very well when they become complicated.
So we started to depend on computers to make different design processes.
And that allows us to produce things much more complex than the normal engineering than normal engineering.
But we don't understand all the choices there are.
In that sense, it's going to be in front of us.
We now use those programs to do much faster and so that we can run these programs much faster.
I mean, it's <unk>
The thing is getting faster and faster and so I think it seems so <unk>
Because all of these technologies are <unk>
We are <unk>
And we're at an analog moment to the <unk> organisms when they became <unk>
We are the <unk> and we can't understand what the hell we're creating.
We're at the turning point.
But I think something comes behind us.
I think it would be very arrogant in our part of thinking that we are the end of evolution.
And I think all of us are part of the creation of what it is.
But now comes the lunch and I think I'll stop here before I was <unk>
I think we have to do something with a part of the medical culture that has to change.
And I think this starts with a doctor, and that's me.
And I've got enough time enough to let myself give up a part of my false <unk> on that.
Before I treat the theme of my talk, let's talk a little bit about baseball.
Why not?
We're close to the end, the World <unk>
We love baseball, right?
The baseball is full of amazing statistics.
There are hundreds of statistics.
It's because of getting <unk> the <unk> talks about the statistics and use them to form a great baseball team.
I'm going to focus on one of them and I hope that many of you have heard of it.
It's called the average <unk>
And we talked about 300 of a <unk> that we have 300.
That means that the bat <unk> <unk> three of 10 times.
That means to launch the ball into the game of game without being <unk> and that anybody who tries to be <unk> to the first base -- didn't get time to time, and the second base will be <unk>
Three <unk>
You know how they call a <unk> of 300 in the Great <unk>
Well, really well, maybe the team of stars.
You know how they call a baseball baseball <unk>
By the way, that is someone that 10 <unk> got to go four.
<unk> as the legendary Ted Williams, the last player in the Afghan League of <unk> in doing more 400 hit a regular season.
Now let's take this to my world of medicine where I feel much more comfortable -- or maybe less uncomfortable, after what I'm going to tell you today.
Suppose you have a <unk> and they are that they have a surgeon that has also a record in <unk>
It doesn't work, right?
Now suppose that they live in a place, and a dear thing has two <unk> <unk> <unk> and his family doctor derived into a cardiologist whose record is <unk>
But you know what?
She's really improving this year.
And their hits have been <unk>
This is not working.
But I'll ask you.
What do you think is to be the average of hits of a heart surgeon or a heart of a nurse or a <unk> <unk>
It is very good.
And the truth of the matter is that nobody in medicine knows the hits of a good surgeon, or a <unk>
What we do, though, is sending them to the world, and I would be included by being perfect.
That would never, ever make a mistake and try to figure out how to do it right.
That was the take-home message when I was in medical school.
I was a graduate student.
Once, a fellow in high school said that Brian Sachs was studied until a blood <unk>
So you know.
<unk> in my little <unk> at the <unk> University of Toronto, not far from here.
And I learned all of memory.
From my class of anatomy, <unk> the origin and the <unk> <unk> the <unk> of every artery that comes out of the <unk> the <unk> <unk> <unk>
And I even knew the differential diagnosis of how to classify the <unk> <unk> <unk>
And as much more and more knowledge.
And I was very well; I graduated with <unk>
And I read about the school of medicine with the impression that if you were able to do everything, then I would know everything, or as possible, close to everything else, because I would get rid of the mistakes.
And it worked for a while, until I met the lady <unk>
I was a resident in a college hospital here in Toronto when they brought to the lady in <unk> to the emergency service where I worked out.
At the time, I was assigned to the service of <unk>
And when the emergency room requested to go to a cardiologist got me going to go to that patient.
and report the chief of residents.
When I saw <unk> <unk> was <unk>
I heard a <unk> sound.
And when I read it, I heard a <unk> sound on both sides, which <unk> me a <unk> heart failure.
In these conditions, the heart stops working and, instead of pump the blood forward, the blood goes into the lungs, these are filled with blood, and that's why there is hard to breathe.
And it wasn't difficult to <unk>
I did it, and I started working on the treatment of the treatment that I was given.
I gave him <unk> and medication to alleviate the pressure on your heart.
I gave him a <unk> of water pills that I could eliminate liquid.
And in one hour or two, she began to feel better.
And I was very good.
And that's when I made the first <unk> he sent him home.
In fact, I made two more errors.
He sent her home without talking to the chief of residents.
I didn't get up the phone and I did what I should have done, that I was calling my chief and <unk> with him for the <unk>
And if my boss would have seen it, I would have been able to achieve <unk> information.
Maybe I did it for a good reason.
Maybe I didn't want to be a resident for constant attention.
Maybe I wanted to be so successful and able to take <unk> that could take care of my patients without even contact my boss.
The second mistake I made was worse.
When I was sending it to her home, I didn't pay attention to a voice on my inside which was saying, <unk> is not a good idea. I don't know it.
In fact, I was so confident that I was able to ask the nurse that he went to her lady <unk> "Do you believe it's okay if you go to his <unk>
And the nurse thought, and then he said to complete <unk> "Yes, I think I'm right."
I remember that as if it was yesterday.
So he signed up the high, and the ambulance along with the ambulance took her home.
And I went back to the hospital.
The rest of that day, that afternoon, I had a bad <unk> in the stomach.
But I went on with my work.
At the end of the day, I was able to leave the hospital and walked into the parking lot where my car was to go home. I did something I don't do normally, and I did something I don't do normally, and I did something I don't do normally, and I did something I don't do normally, and I did something I don't do normally, and I did something I
It happened for the emergency service service at home.
And there was another nurse, not the <unk> of the lady <unk> before, but another one, he told me three words, those three words that most of the emergency medical medical doctors.
Other people fear as well, but there's a <unk> in <unk> and it's that we see patients <unk>
The three words are: you remember this.
He said, "Do you remember the patient's <unk>
I asked the other nurse with total <unk>
And I said, "Well, she <unk> with the same voice.
She was fine.
But I went back and at the edge of death.
After an hour of having come to his house, after I gave him the high school, he had a collapse and his family called the <unk> the ambulance they brought the emergency room with a blood pressure of 50 millimeters of <unk> which means a shock severe.
I could barely breathe and was blue.
The emergency staff -- all of their resources.
They gave them medication to raise blood pressure.
And they put an artificial <unk>
I was <unk> and <unk> to the core.
He had a mix of feelings because after the <unk> was in intensive therapy, and I was hoping against all hope that was <unk>
And in the two or three days it was obvious that he never <unk>
He had a standard brain damage.
The family got together.
And in eight or nine days, it was <unk> to what was happening.
And in ninth day, he left her go. The lady would go.
They say they never forget the names that they die.
That was my first experience.
The next few weeks ago, I was pleased with it, and I experienced for the first time the shame <unk> that exists in our medical culture, and I felt myself, <unk> without feeling that healthy shame because you can't afford with your colleagues.
One makes peace and never more make that mistake.
It's that shame that leaves a teaching.
<unk> <unk> of which I'm talking about is that makes us feel very wrong with it.
It's the one that tells us not that what we did was that what we did was, we are bad.
And that felt.
And it wasn't for my <unk> he was a <unk>
I talked to the family and I'm sure I would get the things out and made sure that I didn't get paid.
And I kept getting those questions.
Why didn't I ask my <unk> Why did he send him home?
And my worst <unk> Why did I made a mistake so <unk>
Why did I choose <unk>
Little to that feeling was <unk>
And I started to feel better.
And on one day <unk> opened up the sky and finally came out the sun. And I wondered if I would feel better again.
And I made a deal with myself, in which if you were able to take the efforts to be perfect to not make more errors, I would hold those voices.
And it was.
I went back to work.
But it came back to happen.
Two years later, it was an interview department in the emergency department in a community hospital in the northern Toronto, and I got a man from 25 years with a pain in <unk>
I was very busy and <unk>
And he pointed out here.
I looked at her because he was a little bit <unk>
He would drink penicillin and sent him home.
But while he was headed to the door he was still pointing out his <unk>
Two days later, when I came to do my <unk> <unk> my boss asked to talk to me <unk> in his office.
And he gave three words: <unk>
Remember the patient he saw by a pain <unk>
Well, he came back and I didn't have a <unk> <unk>
He had a potentially mortal condition called <unk>
You can search for Google. It's an infection, not because of the top, but it can cause the closing of those tracks.
He <unk> he didn't die.
It was <unk> antibiotics by <unk> and recovered in a few days.
And I went through the same time of shame and <unk> and I went back to work, and I went back to work, until over and over again, and again.
Two times in the same turn of the <unk> not <unk> <unk>
And it's a great effort, especially working in a hospital, because they were <unk> to 14 patients at the same time.
But in both cases, I didn't send them home, and I don't think it's been a <unk>
One of them thought I had a <unk> calculation of it.
So it turned out an X-ray of hearts, but it turned out a little bit of a colleague who was checking the patient into the bottom of the bottom right-hand corner, and called the surgeon.
The other patient was with a lot of diarrhea.
I read liquid order to <unk> and I asked my colleague to do it.
And I checked it and see some sensitivity on the bottom right-hand corner, called the surgeon.
Both of them were operated and they recovered as well.
But every single case I would tell me about it.
But I'd like to tell you that I made the worst mistakes in the first five years of exercise, and as a lot of colleagues say, it's a <unk>
The most meaningful has been over the last five years.
<unk> embarrassed and <unk>
And here's the problem: If I can't get myself and talk about my mistakes, if I can't find the <unk> that tells me what really happens, how to share this with my <unk>
How do I teach you this so that they didn't make the same <unk>
If I would go into a place like this, I would have no idea what you think about me.
When was the last time you heard someone talk about failure, after failure, after failure?
Of course at a party you'll hear about the mistakes of other doctors, but you'll not hear someone talk about their own mistakes.
And if I knew and my colleagues too, and my colleagues too, I had a <unk> in my hospital -- the wrong leg. It would have a hard time to look at it in the eyes.
This is the system that we have.
The total denial of mistakes.
It's the system where there are two <unk> who make mistakes and whatever you can't sleep and the ones that are not able to sleep and the ones that have <unk> outcomes and those who have great outcomes.
And it's almost like a <unk> reaction that starts to attack that person.
We have the idea that if you stop medicine to the people that make mistakes, we will get a safe system.
But it brings two problems.
In 20 years, about diffusion and medical journalism, I've done a personal <unk> of bad business and errors doctors for learning as possible, from the first paper that I wrote for Toronto, "Star to my <unk> <unk> Black Black <unk> <unk> white, art.
And what I learned is that errors are <unk>
We worked in a system where errors happen every day in which one in 10 drugs are wrong, or <unk> in the hospital are wrong, or <unk> is not right. In a system where <unk> infections are increasingly and more <unk> causing chaos and death.
In this country, 24,000 Canadian errors are <unk>
The U.S. Medical Institute established 100,000.
In both cases, it's about <unk> <unk> because we're not <unk> the problem as we should.
And that's what things are.
A <unk> system, where the knowledge is added every two or three years, and we don't get <unk>
The sleep deprivation.
And we can't get rid of it.
We have cognitive biases that allow you to make a perfect record of a patient with chest pain.
Now, let's take the same patient with a chest pain in my chest, and it comes <unk> with <unk> eyes and I had breath to alcohol and suddenly my story <unk>
It's not the same story.
I'm not a <unk> I don't do things as well.
And my patients are not cars. They didn't get their symptoms in the same way.
For all of this, the mistakes are inevitable.
So if we take the system like we get rid of us, and we eliminate all the professionals that are likely to error, well, not going to be nobody.
And with respect people don't want to talk about their most <unk>
In my <unk> <unk> white art, that's my worst <unk> I would tell you, "This is my worst <unk> I would tell everybody, from the ambulance to the head of surgery <unk> "This is my worst <unk> blah, blah, <unk> "What are your <unk>
And their students were <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> saliva and start telling their stories.
They want to tell their stories, they want to share them.
<unk> power to say, "Look, don't make the same <unk>
They need a context where they can do it.
They need a medical medical culture.
And it starts with a doctor every time.
The <unk> physician is human, you know -- they accept it, and it doesn't get rid of their mistakes, but it's trying to learn from what happened to teach others.
They would raise their experiences with them.
It's support for those who talk about their mistakes.
They were giving the mistakes of other people not with the intention of <unk> but a loving way of support and support for everyone to get away.
And it works in a medical culture that recognizes human beings run the system, and when this happens, they make mistakes from time to time.
My name is Brian <unk>
I'm a <unk> doctor.
I'm a human, <unk> mistakes ...
And I feel so much, but I strive to learn something that can convey to others.
I don't know what about me, but I can live with that.
And let me conclude with three words <unk> I remember.
Do you know how many decisions we take a <unk>
Do you know how much we choose in a week?
I recently made a survey of more than 2,000 people and the average amount of choice that says to choose an average American, they're about 70 to a day.
It doesn't do a lot, in research on a week to a group of presidents companies.
The researchers recorded the different <unk> tasks for these executives and the time that we were trying to make decisions about those tasks.
They found that, on average, <unk> <unk> a week.
Naturally, every job included lots of <unk>
Half of those decisions took nine minutes or less.
Only 12 percent required an hour or more of your time.
Now think about your elections.
Do you know how many belong to the category of nine minutes, and how many of an hour?
How does the way that deals with those decisions?
Today I want to talk about one of the biggest problems of the <unk> choosing the <unk>
I want to talk about the problem and about possible solutions.
As I talk about this I'm going to ask you a few questions, and I need to know your answers.
When you ask a question, as I'm blind, raise your hand only if you want to burn calories.
Otherwise when you ask a question, if your answer is positive, please give you a <unk>
And now my first question of the day, they're ready to hear about the problem of <unk> <unk>
Thank you.
Being a graduate student at Stanford University, <unk> this very, very <unk> supermarket at least in that time was very sophisticated age.
He was called <unk>
It was almost like going to a <unk> park.
I'd like 250 different kinds of mustard and <unk> over 500 different types of fruits and vegetables and about 25 of <unk> water, and this was when we were taking water from the tap.
I loved going to that store, but at one occasion, I asked myself, why never I buy nothing?
This is a shelf from the oil oil.
They had more than 75 different classes, including those who were in box <unk> that came from <unk> trees.
I once decided to visit a manager and I asked him, <unk> this strategy to offer all these <unk>
He pointed out to me the full buses of tourists they came up every day, usually with their cameras.
So we decided to do a little experiment with <unk> This is the <unk>
hallway.
They had <unk> different classes.
<unk> a post to <unk> right at the gate of the store.
We put it out of six <unk> or 24 different flavors and we look at two things: First, what case people were willing to stop trying to test the <unk>
More people stopped when there were <unk> a dozen that when there was only six, a 40 percent.
We also look at what case they were more likely to buy a jar of <unk>
Here's the opposite effect.
Of those who stopped when there was <unk> only three to buy <unk>
When I had six, we saw that 30 percent bought <unk>
If we do the calculations, people had six times more likely to buy <unk> if they were six.
Well, to decide that we don't buy <unk> we probably want to get less -- less is good to preserve the <unk> but it turns out that the problem of the delivery of options affect us in a good way of decisions.
We decided not to decide, even though this is not <unk>
Now the issue of the day, the financial savings.
I'm going to describe to you a study that I did with <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> where we look at the savings decisions for the retirement of about a million Americans, between about 650 plans of this country.
We were interested in looking at whether the number of money available in plans for retirement plans for retirement, the <unk> program <unk> people to save for the future.
And we found that I actually had a <unk>
We had <unk> plans that were going from two, to 59 different options.
We found that the bigger it was the number of <unk> <unk> there were less participation.
So if we look at the extreme, we see that in the plans that offer two funding, the death rate was 70 or more, not as high as I wanted to.
And in the plans that offered about 60 <unk> the death rate went to the <unk> 1960s.
It turns out that even if you decide to participate, when there's more options, even in that case, there is negative consequences.
So for those who decided to participate, as much as the number of options, more people are going to stand up to avoid actions or hedge funds.
As much more options, they were more willing to invest in market financial accounts.
But none of these extreme decisions are the ones that we need to optimize to optimize the future financial well-being.
In the previous decade, we've seen three major negative consequences to offer more and more possibilities.
The more likely it is that we will make the decision that <unk> even when this is going against their own interest.
It's more likely to take the worst decisions in finance and health.
They are more likely to choose things less <unk> even though objectively it is going to be better.
The main reason is that we're going to be able to look at that variety of giant <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> but we are not able to do the calculations for which we compare to contrast and choosing that awesome <unk>
Today I want to give you four simple techniques that we have, in one way or another, in different research, so that you can test in their business.
The first one is, <unk>
You've heard it before, but it's never been more true than today, which is less than more.
People are always upset when I say, <unk>
Do you care about losing space in <unk>
But actually what we're seeing is that if you decide to cut, get rid of strange <unk> choices -- there will be a <unk> increase in sales, there will be a better experience in the election.
When <unk> & <unk> went from 26 different types of <unk> & <unk> to 15, saw 10 percent in sales.
When a corporation Golden <unk> eliminated the products for us to feed them out of cats that are less <unk> they have increased the <unk> in <unk> by two major sales and lower <unk>
You know that the Vietnam Beijing, you have 45 products.
In a grocery store there is about 100,000 products.
But the ninth largest store in the world is <unk> and it offers only 1,400 <unk> a kind of tomato sauce set.
In the financial savings, I think that one of the best examples that have emerged about how to handle the best options is the <unk> of David <unk> the Harvard program.
All the employees at Harvard are automatically <unk> at a safe safe security.
The people who really want to choose, they give them 20, not 300 or more.
You know that people often say, "I don't know how to <unk>
They are all options <unk>
The first thing I do is ask the <unk> <unk> the differences that are among those options.
And if your employees can't afford it, you can't afford it either.
This afternoon, before I started this session, I was chatting with <unk>
He told me that he would be willing to offer people in this audience on a holiday with all paid to the most beautiful road in the world.
Here, a <unk>
I want you to read it.
I'm going to leave a few seconds to <unk> and then I want you to give me a round of applause. If you're ready to take the supply of <unk>
<unk> Okay. Anyone who is ready to accept sale.
They're not more?
Well, I'm going to show you something else.
You knew there was a trick.
Who is ready for that <unk>
I think I really got to hear more hands.
All right.
Actually, you had more information in the first turn, than in the second way, but I can tell you that they thought the second time it was more real.
Because the images were making it look more real.
This brings me to the second technique to deal with the <unk> problem with choice which is <unk>
So people understand differences between options, they have to understand the consequences of each choice, and that the consequences must be feeling very <unk> very concrete,
Why is people spending 15 to 30 percent more on average, when you use debit or credit cards that when you use <unk>
Because it doesn't seem to be real money.
It turns out to make it look more real, it can be a very positive tool for people to do more.
We did a study with <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> about <unk> <unk> who worked in <unk> these people were in a meeting where they were getting into a <unk> plan.
And to that meeting, which is exactly like <unk> we made a little <unk>
So what we added was that I would give the staff to think about the positive things that they would do in their lives if they were saving more money.
With this <unk> there was an increase in <unk> of 20 percent and increase in the number that they were interested in saving or in what they wanted to put in their <unk> accounts of <unk>
The third technique is <unk>
We can handle more categories that we can handle on.
For example, this is a study that we did in a magazine theater.
We saw that in the supermarket.
But you know?
Because <unk> tells me how to <unk>
These are two <unk>
One is called <unk> and the other, <unk>
If you think the one on the left is <unk> and the one on the right is <unk> for a <unk>
<unk> Well, there's a few.
If you think the one on the left is <unk> and the one on the right is <unk> for a <unk>
Well, something else.
It turns out it's right.
The one on the left is <unk> and the one on the right is <unk> but you know what?
This classification scheme is completely useless.
The categories must tell you something that you don't want to say to you not when they <unk>
And so you often see this problem with these huge funding.
I mean who are <unk>
My fourth <unk> <unk> complexity.
It turns out we can manage a lot more information than we think, if you just get it a little bit.
We have to increase complexity gradually.
I'm going to show you an example of what I mean.
Let's look at a very good decision buying a car.
This is a German manufacturer of cars that allow <unk> completely.
You have to take 60 decisions, to build the car.
And these decisions vary in the number of options that offers each one.
I have <unk> outside of the car. I have 56 possibilities.
<unk> box <unk> four options.
What I'm going to do is to vary the order of decisions that happen.
So half of the customers are going to go from a lot of options, 56 colors, a few times four boxes.
The other half of the customers are going to go from a few choices, four <unk> in 56 colors, a lot of options.
And what am I going to <unk>
How much do you do?"
If you get <unk> the default button in every decision, this indicates that they're <unk> or <unk> we are <unk>
We found that the ones that are going to have a lot of choices at a few choices -- <unk> the default button over and over again, and another more.
<unk>
If you go from a few options in a lot, they go there.
Same information, the same number of options.
The only thing that I did was alter the order of the information.
If we start with what's easy, you learn to <unk>
Even though the pick of changes does not say anything about the preferences of interior <unk> in all ways make us a choice.
We are excited about a product that we're building is that we are building that now has more <unk> with the process.
To sum up.
I've talked about four techniques to mitigate the problem of <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> we can drive more categories with less <unk> <unk> complexity.
All of these techniques that I've been presented with were designed to help manage the <unk> or better for you, to use them in their own business, or for people who work.
So I think the key to you to get the best of a choice is to be careful about <unk>
And the more they be able to be in our choices we might be able to practice the art of choice.
Thank you very much.
In the <unk> East Germany, <unk> if you had a typewriter to write it to the government.
You had to register a sheet of text from written with the machine.
And this is so that the government could track the origin of the texts.
If they found a written written with the wrong message, you could track the footprint to the origin of the idea.
In the West we don't think that someone could do this, so much that this is a lot of <unk> freedom of expression.
We would never do that in our countries.
But today, in 2011, if you buy a laser printer from any big manufacturer of any big manufacturer and print one page, that page will end with a few little yellow dots on every page that makes a pattern of one and your printer.
That's happening today.
And nobody seems to be a lot of <unk>
This is an example of the ways that our governments use technology against us, citizens.
And it's one of the three main causes of problems on the network.
If we see what happens in the online world we can put together the attacks according to their <unk>
There are three main groups.
Are you the <unk>
Like Mr. <unk> <unk> in Ukraine.
<unk> mobile phone is very easy to understand.
These guys make money.
They use cyberattacks to earn a lot of money, huge amounts of money.
There are really a lot of the <unk> online, <unk> that <unk> money with their attacks.
This is <unk> <unk> of <unk> <unk>
This is Alfred <unk>
This is Stephen <unk>
This is <unk> <unk>
These are Matthew Anderson, and <unk> etc., etc., etc.
These guys do their online <unk> but they do it by illegal media by stealing banking and steal money from our bills when we bought in <unk> or steal our keys to get information from our cards when we bought in a <unk> computer.
The secret service of America, two months ago, <unk> the Swiss account of this guy, Sam <unk> and this account had <unk> million dollars when it was frozen.
Mr. <unk> is <unk> <unk> <unk>
And I say today is more likely that any of us is a victim of a <unk> than a real crime.
And it's very obvious that this is going to be wrong.
In the future, most crime crimes online.
The second group of <unk> in importance today is not driven by money.
There is another thing that moves them, they motivate them the protests, motivate their opinions, they motivate them.
groups like Anonymous have been <unk> in the last 12 months occupying a big role in the online attacks.
Those are the three <unk> <unk> criminals who do it for money, <unk> them as Anonymous who do it for protest and the last group are the national America, governments that are <unk>
And then we see cases like <unk>
That's a good example of the government attack against their own citizens.
<unk> is an authority of <unk> in the Netherlands or indeed it was.
<unk> the <unk> last fall because of a <unk>
It was going to be the safety of the site and attack a <unk>
Last week I asked, at a meeting with representative government representatives asked one of the leaders if they were to <unk> the death of people from the attack to <unk>
And the answer to him was yes.
So how do people die from an attack of these?
<unk> is an authority.
<unk> <unk>
Why do they serve <unk>
Well, you need if you have a website with <unk> services, <unk> services like <unk>
Except that they <unk> a foreign authority authority.
And that I was going to say to <unk> <unk>
And in the case of <unk> it happened.
And what happened in the Arab Spring and those things that have happened, for example, in <unk>
Well, in Egypt, the <unk> protesters -- the headquarters of the secret police headquarters in April 2011, and during the building <unk> they found a lot of papers.
Among those papers was this folder called <unk>
And within that folder there were notes from a company based in Germany that had sold the Egyptian tools to intercept a large scale in the communications of the citizens of the country.
They had been sold this tool by 280 euros to the <unk> government.
The company headquarters is right here.
And so, Western governments provide the tools to government governments to do this to their citizens.
But Western governments are also doing this themselves.
For example, in Germany, just a couple weeks ago, I found the <unk> <unk> a <unk> used by the German government officers to investigate their own citizens.
If you are <unk> in a criminal case, you know, it's pretty obvious that your phone is <unk>
But now it goes further.
<unk> the Internet connection.
<unk> even tools like <unk> <unk> to infect our computer with a <unk> to allow them to see the communication, and listen to the wrong discussions to get our data.
When we think about things like these the obvious answer should be "Well, it looks like a bad thing, but it doesn't really affect me because I'm an honest citizen.
Why would you care?
I have nothing to do it.
And that argument doesn't make sense.
It's in play with privacy.
Privacy is not <unk>
It's not a question of privacy against security.
It's about freedom against control.
If you might well be able to rely on our governments today in 2011, any right that we're going to do today, being forever.
<unk> blind in any future government, in a administration we could have within 50 years?
These are the questions that have been worried about the next 50 years.
This is where I live in Kenya, in the south of Park in Nairobi.
These are the cows of my dad, and behind the <unk> the National Park in Nairobi.
The National Park in Nairobi has no fences at most of the South, which means that wild animals like <unk> are freely outside the park.
And predators, like lions, and this is what they do.
<unk> our cattle.
This is one of the people who killed at night, and as soon as we wake up in the morning and we found him dead -- I felt very bad because it was the only driver's <unk>
My community, the <unk> we think we came from the sky with our animals and all the land to <unk> and so we value it.
So I grew up <unk> a lot to lions.
<unk> are warriors that protect our community and cattle, and they are also mad about the problem.
So kill lions.
This is one of the six lions who killed in Nairobi.
I think that's why there are so few in the National Park in Nairobi.
A child in my community, six to nine years, is responsible for the livestock of his father and this was the same thing that I would happen to me.
So I had to find a way to solve this problem.
My first idea was to use fire, because I thought to the lions <unk>
But I realized that this was actually not <unk> because it even helped the lions to see the pen away.
I didn't get <unk> <unk>
A second idea was to use a <unk>
He was trying to trick the lions to believe that I was close to the <unk>
But lions are very intelligent.  They came the first day and saw the <unk> and they were gone, but the second day, they went and said, this thing is not moving, it's always here.  So he jumped and killed animals.
So one night I was walking around the pen with a torch and that day lions didn't go.
I found out that lions are afraid of light that it moves.
So I had an idea.
And I got a switch on which you can turn on and turn the lights off.
And this is a little lamp from a broken <unk>
<unk> everything.
As you can see, the solar panel load up the battery and the battery -- electricity on the little box <unk> I call it a transformative.
And the <unk> box makes the lights <unk>
As you can see, the <unk> get outside, because that's where the lions.
And this is how they see lions when they come from night.
The lights are <unk> and <unk> to lions to think that I'm walking through the <unk> but I'm sleeping in my bed.
Thank you.
So I put them in my house two years ago, and since then, we never had trouble with lions.
And the neighborhood houses heard the idea.
One of them is from this grandmother.
She had killed a lot of animals and lions and asked me if I could put the lights up.
I said yes.
<unk> you can see at the bottom, these are the lights for lions.
Since then, I've put it in seven houses in my community, and they're serving a lot.
And my idea is also used by all of Kenya, to freak out other predators like able, <unk> and also is being used to get rid of their farms.
Because of this invention, I was fortunate to get a grant in one of the best schools in Kenya, <unk> International School and I'm very excited.
My new school now is helping to raise money and <unk>
It even took my friends to my community and we installed lights on the houses that don't have them, and I teach them how to <unk>
So a year ago, I was just a kid in the lawns in the savanna <unk> the cows of my father, and I used to see planes fly, and he said that someday would be inside of you.
And here I am.
I had a chance to come in plane for the first time to TED.
My great dream is to be a aviation engineer and a pilot when I grow up.
I used to hate the lions, but now as my invention is saving cows of my dad and the lions, we can be with lions without a conflict.
<unk> <unk> What in my language means, thank you very much.
Chris Anderson: You don't know what exciting is to listen to a story like you.
So you got a <unk> Richard <unk> Yes.
CA: Are you working on other electrical inventions in the other.
What's the next one on your <unk>
<unk> My next invention is -- I want to do a little electric fence -- CA: A close <unk>
<unk> I know that they were already invented electrical fences -- but I want to make mine.
CA: So I read it once, once, right, and <unk> <unk> I have tried before, but I had a couple of them, because I got a <unk>  CA: When you go out of <unk> Richard <unk> you're a big thing.
We are going to <unk> on every step that you would have friend of mine.
Thank you very much. <unk> Thank you very much.
When I was a little girl, I thought my country was the best on the planet.
And I grew up singing a song called "No <unk>
And I felt very proud.
In school, we would move all the time studying the story of Kim <unk> but we never learned a lot about the rest of the world, except that America, South Korea, Japan are the enemies.
But sometimes I was wondering about the rest of the world, I thought I would spend my whole life in North Korea, until it changed all of a sudden changed.
When I was seven years old, I saw my first public performance.
But I thought my life in North Korea was normal.
My family was not poor and I was never hungry.
But one day, in 1995, my mom brought home a letter from my sister.
That said, "When I did this, the five members of the family will stop there in this world, because we haven't eaten in the last two weeks.
We are <unk> together on the floor, and our bodies are so weak that we're prepared to die."
It was very altered.
It was the first time I heard that people were suffering in my country.
When I was walking in front of the train station, I saw something terrible that I can't erase my memory.
A woman without life was dead in the street, holding a child <unk> in his arms looking at her mother and looking at her mother without being able to do anything.
No one <unk> because they were very concerned about saving them and their families.
A huge famine called North Korea to the <unk>
In the end, over a million North Koreans died during famine and only a few survived eating grass, insects and the tree.
They also became more and more frequent <unk> all around me was completely dark at night except for the lights of the sea in China, just crossing the river from my home.
I always wondered why they had light and we don't.
This is a satellite picture of North Korea at night compared to the neighboring countries.
This is the <unk> River, which serves between North Korea and China.
As you can see, the river can be very <unk> in certain points, allowing North Koreans to cross <unk>
But many people die.
Sometimes, I saw bodies floating in the river.
I can't reveal the details of how I came out of North Korea, but I can only say that during the years of starvation I was sent to China to live with relatives <unk>
But I just thought I'd be separate from my family for the short time.
I could never have imagined it would take 14 years to live together.
In China, it was hard to live as a young woman without my family.
I had no idea how life would be like a <unk>
But I also learned that it's not just extremely difficult, but dangerous, because refugee refugees in China were considered illegal immigrants in China.
So I was living with a constant fear that my identity was <unk> and it would be <unk> to a horrible fate of back in North Korea.
A day, my worst nightmare was actually done when I was arrested by the Chinese police, and I was <unk> at the police station.
Someone had been accused of being <unk> then I was <unk> my skills in the Chinese language and asked me a lot of questions.
I was <unk>
I thought my heart was going to grow.
If it didn't seem natural, it could be incarcerated and <unk>
I thought my life was going to end.
But I managed to control my emotions and answered the questions.
At the end of the <unk> a officer told another, "This was a false report. She's not <unk>
And let me go. It was a miracle.
Some North Koreans are looking at <unk> <unk>
But many of them can be arrested by the Chinese police, and <unk>
These women had a lot of luck.
Although there'd be had been eventually released after a harsh international pressure.
These Koreans were not so lucky.
Every year, countless Koreans are captured in China and <unk> to North Korea, where they're <unk> <unk> or executed in public.
Even though I was lucky to leave, many other Koreans have not had so much luck.
It's tragic that North Koreans have to hide their identities and fight so hard just to survive.
Even after learning a new language and find work, all his world can be done in a second.
That's why after 10 years of hiding my identity -- I've decided to wear by South Korea to South Korea.
And I started a new life again.
<unk> in South Korea was a much greater challenge of what was expected.
English was very important in South Korea, I had to start learning my third language.
Also, I understood that there was a big gap between North and South America.
We're all <unk> but inside, we've come to be very different because of 67 years of <unk>
I even went through an identity crisis.
I'm a <unk> or <unk>
Where am I? Who am I?
Suddenly there was no country I could call with pride of mine.
Even though we went to the life in South Korea it was not easy, I started to study for a plan. I started to study for the student of income to college.
Just when I was starting to <unk> my new life, I got an alarming call.
The North Korean authorities had a little bit of money that submitted to my family, and as blame my family was going to be displaced to the force to a location by the <unk>
They had to run away.
So I started planning how to help them escape.
The North Koreans have to travel long distances on the way to freedom.
It's almost impossible to cross the border between North Korea and South Korea.
So, ironically, I took a flight to China and walked into the border with North Korea.
Since my family couldn't speak Chinese, I had to do it somehow, for over three thousand miles across China and then across Southeast Asia.
The journey in <unk> took a week, and we were almost caught several times.
Once, our bus was stopped and addressed by a Chinese police officer.
He asked the identification of it, and he started asking them questions.
As my family couldn't understand Chinese, I thought my family was going to be arrested.
When the Chinese officer came up to my family, <unk> I stood up and told him that they were <unk> people who were <unk>
I looked at me <unk> but fortunately I did.
We did all the way to the <unk> border.
But I had to spend almost all my money to bribe the border guards in <unk>
But even after the border, my family was arrested and incarcerated by crossing the <unk> border.
After paying <unk> and bribes, my family was liberated in a month.
But in time, my family was arrested and incarcerated again in the capital capital.
This was one of the lowest points in my life.
I did all of my family, and we were so close, but my family was <unk> in prison at short distance from the embassy of South Korea.
I was going to go between the immigration office and the police station, desperately trying to liberate my family.
But it didn't have enough money to pay more bribes or <unk>
I lost hope.
At that moment, or the voice of a male man, "What is the problem?"
I was so shocked that a stranger would mind to ask.
With my poor English and a dictionary, I gave him the situation, and I gave him the man -- the man was to the <unk> <unk> and gave me the rest of the money for my family and for another two North Koreans and to get them out of prison.
I read him with all my heart, and I asked him, "Why do I <unk>
"I'm not <unk> he said.
"I'm helping the village <unk>
I realized that that was a symbolic moment in my life.
The kind unknown is <unk> a new hope for me and for the people to do that when you get it.
And I showed myself that the kindness of strangers and the support of the international community are really the rays of hope that the people are going to need to.
Over time, after our long trip, my family and I came up in South Korea, and I came up in South Korea, and I came up with South Korea, and I came up with South Korea, and I came up with South Korea, in South Korea, we came up with South Korea, in South Korea, we came up with South Korea, and I came up with South Korea, and I
But getting their freedom is only half the battle.
A lot of North Koreans are separated from their families and when they went to a new country, they start with a little bit of money.
So, we can benefit from the international community with education, practice in the English language practice and more.
We can also act as the bridge between people in North Korea and the rest of the world.
Because a lot of us carry on contact with family with their own, and we send information and money that is helping to change North Korea from within.
I've been very <unk> I've gotten a lot of help and inspiration in my life, so I want to help North America, an opportunity to thrive with international support.
I'm sure you're going to see more and more North Koreans in the world, including the TED stage.
Thank you.
I live in South <unk>
This is <unk> <unk> stores of <unk> fast food, <unk>
So the planners of the city came together and they thought, we're going to change the South Center for it to represent something else, so they changed to Los Angeles in the way, as if this is actually wrong in the city.
This is Los Angeles --  <unk> <unk> fast food, <unk>
Just like <unk> million other Americans, I live in a food desert. The Los Angeles South, home to the food places to get and eat in the car.
What was curious about is that food places to get killing more people than food in the car.
People are dying of <unk> diseases in Los Angeles Center.
For example, the rate of obesity in my neighborhood is five times bigger than say, Beverly <unk> that's like 15 miles away.
I think this will happen.
And I ask myself, how would you feel if you didn't have access to healthy food, and if every time you go out of the house you see the <unk> effects that the current food system has in their <unk>
I see chairs <unk> and sold as <unk> cars.
I see <unk> centers like <unk>
And I think this must stop.
I think the problem is the solution.
Food is the problem, and it's the solution.
And I also got tired of driving 45 minutes and back to buy an apple that has no <unk>
What I did, was to plant a food forest in front of my house.
In a sliver of land we call a <unk>
It's 45 feet x three me.
The point is, it belongs to the city.
But you have to run it out.
I said, "Well, I can do what I'm coming in to me, because it's my responsibility and I have to <unk>
This is how I decided it worked.
So my group and I, L.A. Green <unk> we got together, and we started to plant our food forest -- trees -- you know, nine vegetables completely.
What we do, we are a kind of paid paid by ahead of the <unk> of all the <unk> and completely volunteer, and everything we do is free.
And the garden, was beautiful.
And then someone would be <unk>
The city was on me, and <unk> gave me a <unk> saying that I had to take my yard, and the <unk> was done <unk>
And I said, "Come on it?
A court store for planting food in a piece of land than no one <unk>  And so I was like, "Well, let's <unk>
Because this time wasn't going to happen.
So Times had the story written by Steve <unk> and I talked to the <unk> and one of the members of Green Green who put a petition in <unk> with 900 <unk> we were a success.
We had the victory in our hands.
My <unk> even called to say that <unk> and <unk> what we were doing.
I mean, we go, why not?
L.A. is the city of America with more <unk>
It's 68 miles of <unk>
That equals 20 Central Central
That's a space enough to plant <unk> million plants.
Why on earth don't look like this?
<unk> a plant to give a thousand seeds.
When a dollar of <unk> will give you 75 dollars to result.
It's my <unk> when I tell people, you cultivate your own food.
<unk> your own food is like print your own money.
You see, I have a legacy for South Center.
I grew up there. I grew up there.
I was reminded of this <unk> reality that was <unk> for me for others, and I'm going to manufacture my own reality.
You see, I'm an artist.
<unk> is my <unk> I grew my art.
Such a <unk> artist <unk> walls, I <unk> soils, <unk>
I use the garden, soil like a piece of canvas, and the plants and the trees, are my <unk> of that canvas.
You can see what the Earth can do, if you leave your canvas.
You just can't imagine how amazing it is a <unk> and how people affect people.
What happened?
I witnessed how my garden became a tool of education, transformation of my neighborhood.
To change the community, you have to change the composition of the ground.
We are the land.
They are <unk> to see how to affect kids.
<unk> is the most <unk> act that you can do, especially in a <unk>
In addition, you get <unk>
I remember one occasion, that came a mother and her daughter, and they were like the <unk> of the night and they were in my backyard, and they looked very <unk>
I, well, man, man, I felt bad that they were there, and I said, you know, you don't have to do this like this.
This is on the street for a reason.
I feel shame to see people who were so close to me with hungry, and this just reinforces why I do this, people ask me, <unk> not temes that people go to steal your <unk>
I say, "Why? Oh my God, I don't fear you go to <unk>
That's the street.
That's what it's about.
I want the <unk> but at your time, I want you to get your <unk>
There was another time I put a garden in a <unk> shelter in the center of Los Angeles.
They were these guys, who helped me download the truck.
It was great, they gave me their stories about how this was affected and how it used to plant with her mom and her grandmother, and it was great to see how this changed, so just for a moment.
So Green <unk> has come to plant maybe 20 <unk>
We've had about 50 people that go, they work and <unk> all of them in plan.
If the kids are growing up, the kids will eat <unk>
If you grow tomatoes, they'll eat <unk>  But if nothing of this is going to be <unk> if you don't teach them how the food affects the mind and your body, eat blind what they put in front of you.
I see young people who want to work, but they have this thing in which you're going, I see the color of color that are in this path designed for them, that it doesn't take them nowhere.
With the <unk> I see an opportunity where we can train these kids that are <unk> from their communities to have a sustainable life.
And when we do this, who knows?
Maybe the next George George Washington <unk>
But if we don't change the composition of land, we never will.
Now this is one of my plans, this is something I want to do.
I want to plant a whole block of gardens, where people can share food in the same block.
I want to wear <unk> and turn them into healthy <unk>
I don't care about it.
I'm not talking about free things, because free is not sustainable.
What's interesting about sustainability, is you have to <unk>
What I'm talking about is to put people to work with people, getting the kids out of the street, who know the joy, the pride and the honor of growing their own food, opening markets of farmers.
What I want to do here, we have to make it sexy.
I want everyone to become <unk> <unk> <unk> gardeners <unk>
We need to change the script of what's a <unk>
If you're not a <unk> you're not a <unk>
So the <unk> take their <unk> OK?
That is your weapon of choice.
In <unk> if you want to meet with me, well, if you want to see me, you don't call me if you want to sit in comfortable chairs and have meetings to talk about doing some <unk> to talk about doing some shit.
If you want to see me, you come to the garden with your <unk> so that we can plant something.
Peace Thank you.
Thank you.
<unk> <unk> <unk>  You probably all agree with me that this is a very nice road whatsoever.
It's made of <unk> and asphalt is a good material to drive, but not always, especially in days like today, where it rains a lot.
You can have a lot of water in the asphalt that they <unk>
And especially if you go on the <unk> and these cars go out -- that's not very nice.
In addition, the asphalt can make a lot of noise.
It's a noisy material, and if we build roads, like in the Netherlands, very close to the cities, we want a silent road on the world.
The solution to that is to make roads <unk>
The asphalt is a material that we use right now in most of the roads in the Netherlands, and it has pores and water can move through it, so all the water of rain flow over the sides and you will have a road that is easy to drive, and you don't get water from it anymore.
Noise will also disappear in these <unk>
Because it's very open, all the noise -- so it's a very quiet road machine.
It also has <unk> of course, and the downside of this road is that you can <unk>
What is <unk> See that on this road rocks <unk>
A stone, then several more and more and more, and so on, well, I'm not going to do that.  But you can hurt your <unk> and you're not happy with that.
And finally, this can also lead to more and more harm.
Sometimes they can create <unk> with that.
<unk> It's ready.
<unk> of course, you can become a problem, but we have a solution.
So here you can actually see the damage in this material.
It's a asphalt asphalt as I said, so it only has a little bit of <unk> between stones.
Because of the <unk> to light <unk> to the <unk> this <unk> this <unk> the glue between the <unk> are <unk> and if you <unk> they're going to be <unk> and you get out of the <unk>
So if you drive on the road, you get the <unk> as we saw it here.
To solve this problem, we think of <unk> materials.
If we can make this material <unk> then we probably have a solution.
So what we can do is use <unk> and steel wool -- and we can cut the sheet of steel into some very small pieces, and we can mix those little bits with the <unk>
So we have asphalt with little bits of steel sheet in it.
And then you need a machine, like the one you see here, you use to <unk> a <unk> machine.
<unk> can <unk> especially steel -- it's very good at that.
So what you need to do is heat the steel to melt steel -- melt the <unk> the <unk> flow through these <unk> and stones will spread back to the surface.
I used an oven, <unk> because I can't bring the big <unk> machine here to the stage.
The microwave oven, is a similar system.
I put the sample, which I'm going to take you to see what happened.
This is the sample that comes out now.
I said we have this kind of industrial machine in the lab to heat the samples.
We tried a lot of samples there and then the government, they actually saw our results, and they thought, "Well, that's very interesting. We have to <unk>
So we donated a piece of road 400 feet from the highway highway where we had to do a lane of trial to test this material.
So that's what we did there. You see where we were doing the road, and then of course, this road lasts several years without any harm. That's what we know about practice.
We took a lot of samples from this road and test them in the lab.
We made the samples, we put a lot of payload in them, the products then with our <unk> machine, and we went back to it.
We can repeat this a lot of times.
Well, to conclude, I can say that we've made a material using fibers of steel, bringing these fibers, using the energy of <unk> to actually increase the life of the road, even you can even double the life of the surface -- they can even save a lot of money with very simple tricks.
And now, of course, they are curious about whether this worked.
We still have the sample here. It's pretty hot.
Actually, it's got to cool first before I can show you how it looks like this.
But I'm going to do a try.
Let's see. Yes, it worked.
Thank you.
When I was 11, I remember having woken up one morning with the sound of the <unk> in my house.
My father was listening to BBC News on his little gray radius.
I had a great smile in his face that was unusual at the face -- because the news generally does it.
"The Taliban brother shook my father.
I didn't know what <unk> but I could see my father was very, very happy.
"Now you can go to a <unk> school, he said.
One morning I will never forget.
A real school.
You see, I was six years old when the Taliban were <unk> from Afghanistan and made that girls were to school.
For the next five years, I was scared as a child to join my older sister who could no longer be used outside, to go to a secret school.
It was the only way that two we could <unk>
Every day, we were taking a path different so that nobody could be suspect where they are.
We had to hide the books in shopping bags so that we were shopping.
The school was at a home, over 100 of us in a small room.
It was nice in the winter, but extremely <unk> in the summer.
We all knew that <unk> our lives, the teacher, the students and our parents.
Back in a while, the school was suddenly <unk> because the Taliban <unk>
We always wondered what they knew of us.
They were <unk>
Did you know where <unk>
We were <unk> but still, school was where we wanted to be.
I was very lucky to grow in a family where education was <unk> and the daughters a <unk>
My grandfather was an extraordinary man for his time.
A total <unk> of a remote province in Afghanistan -- in which his daughter, my mother, went to school, and so his father would hold it.
But my mother educated was <unk>
This is it.
It took two years ago, just to turn our house in school for girls and women in our neighborhood.
And my father, this is the first of his family in getting education.
There was no doubt that his children had to receive education, even their daughters, despite the <unk> despite the risks.
For him, there was a higher risk in not to educate their children.
During the years of <unk> I remember that I was very frustrated with our life and was always scared and I didn't see a future.
I wanted to give up, but my father said, <unk> daughter of mine, can lose everything you have in life.
They can steal your money. You can get your home for a war.
But there's one thing that will always be with you, what's here and if we have to sell our blood to pay your education, we will do it.
So you still want to kill me.
I'm 22 years old.
I grew up in a country that has been destroyed by decades of war.
Less than six percent of the women in my age have more than the middle and if my family had not been so committed to my education, I would be one of them.
Instead, I find myself a proud to graduate school in <unk>
When I came back to Afghanistan, my grandfather, the one who was <unk> her home for the courage to educate his daughters, it was one of the first <unk>
He didn't just get away from my college degree, but also that I was the first woman, and I'm the first woman, and I carry it on the streets of Kabul.
My family believes in me.
I am in big, but my family has even bigger dreams for <unk>
That's why I'm the global ambassador, of <unk> a global campaign to educate women.
This is why we <unk> <unk> the first and perhaps the only private school school in Afghanistan, a country which is still risky for girls to go to school.
What's exciting is I see the students in my school with the strong desire to harness the opportunity.
And I see their parents and their families who, as the baby, <unk> by them, even though in front of an opposition <unk>
Like <unk> It's not his real name, and I can't show you your face, but Ahmed is the father of one of my students.
Less than a month, he and his daughter was going out of the way from <unk> to her village, and literally <unk> from being killed by a bomb on the way, for minutes.
When you get to your house, they are the phone, a voice <unk> that if he kept sending her daughter to school, they would go back to it.
<unk> now, if you <unk> he said, "but not harm the future of my daughter for her old and <unk> ideas."
What I've given to you about Afghanistan, and it's something that is often forgotten in the West, is that behind most of the people who <unk> there is a father who recognized the value of his daughter and he sees the success of her own success.
It doesn't mean that our mothers have not been key to our success.
In fact, they often are the first compelling <unk> of the bright future of their daughters, but in the context of a society like the Afghanistan, we need the support of men.
Under the <unk> the girls who were to school they tell in <unk> remember, it was illegal.
But today, over three million girls go to school in Afghanistan.
Afghanistan looks as different from here in the U.S.
I find that Americans see the fragility of changes.
They would argue that these changes didn't last long after the retirement of the U.S.
But when I go back to Afghanistan, when I see the students in my school and their parents who were <unk> by them, and I see the <unk> I see a <unk> future and a lasting change.
For me, Afghanistan is a country of hope and possibilities <unk> and every day the girls of <unk> I would tell you.
Like me, they dream big.
Thank you.
Never forgotten the words of my grandmother who died in the <unk> <unk> resists <unk> against him.
But you never get a <unk> <unk> <unk>
They've spent about two years since the revolution <unk> inspired by the surge of mass <unk> so much of the <unk> revolution like <unk>
A forces with many other citizens <unk> inside and outside of the country to call one day of anger and start a revolution against the <unk> regime of <unk>
And <unk> was a great revolution.
Women and young men who were <unk> they were in the middle of the regime, each of the regime, by providing freedom, dignity and social justice.
You've shown a <unk> bravery to the <unk> <unk>
They've shown a great sense of solidarity from the <unk> East, to the West to the south.
Finally, after a six months of brutal war, and some losses from about 50,000 dead -- we managed to liberate our country and overthrowing the <unk>
However, <unk> left a heavy burden -- a legacy of <unk> corruption and <unk>
For four decades, the <unk> regime -- destroyed the infrastructure, the culture and the moral structure of society.
<unk> from the devastation and the challenges, I've loved a lot of other women, to rebuild civil society -- <unk> <unk> the <unk> transition and fair to democracy and the national reconciliation and philosophy.
There's about 200 organizations in <unk> <unk> and immediately after the fall of <unk> about 300 to <unk>
After a period of 33 years of <unk> I went back to Libya and with a single enthusiasm -- I began to organize workshops about developing capabilities, and leadership skills.
With an amazing group of women we founded the <unk> of Women -- <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> to advocate for the <unk> autonomy of the woman and for our right of the <unk> of democracy in the building of democracy and peace.
I found myself with a very difficult environment in the period of <unk> an environment that was getting more and more <unk> than the selfish of domination and <unk>
Over time, our initiative was <unk> and successful.
Women won a <unk> of National Congress in the first elections in 52 years.
However, little bit of little, the elation of the election and the revolution as a whole, they were <unk> every day we found out of violence.
One day we woke up with the news of the <unk> of mosques and <unk> <unk>
Another day <unk> with the news of the murder of the American ambassador, and the attack on the <unk>
Another day we woke up with the news of the murder of the Army.
And every day, every day we woke up with the government of the <unk> and their <unk> rapes of the human rights and their lack of respect of law.
Our society, made out of a revolutionary mindset, which is more, and it's been away from the ideals and the principles of freedom, dignity, social justice, which we had at the beginning.
<unk> <unk> and revenge became the icons of the consequences of the revolution.
I'm not here today at <unk> with our success story of <unk> <unk> and elections.
So I'm here today to say that we, as a nation, we chose evil, we make the wrong decision.
We don't prioritize well.
Because the choices didn't get peace and stability and security to Libya.
The list <unk> and the <unk> between candidates and <unk> brought in peace and reconciliation <unk>
No, they didn't.
What happened then?
Why is our society still <unk> and dominated by selfish and <unk> political policies, both for men like <unk>
Perhaps what was missing was not only women, but the female values of compassion, mercy and <unk>
Our society needs the national dialogue.
Our nation needs the women's depiction of women more than we need <unk> and quantitative <unk>
We need to stop acting as an artist's agents and call it a few days of anger.
We need to start acting as agents of compassion and mercy.
We need to develop a female discourse that not only <unk> but also putting sense in practice <unk> instead of <unk> collaboration instead of competition, the inclusion of the <unk>
These are the ideals that the Libya, <unk> by war, desperately needs the end of the peace.
Because peace has a <unk> which is about the <unk> and <unk> between women's <unk> and <unk>
That's the real <unk>
We need to establish that in an existential way before we do it <unk>
According to a <unk> of the Koran <unk> <unk> "is the word of God <unk> <unk> <unk>
At the time, the word <unk> which is known in all of the traditions -- it has the same root in Arabic that the word <unk> <unk> the female and <unk> that leads to all the humanity that men and women, where all tribes and all of the villages have <unk>
And so, just like the uterus covers entirely the <unk> that grows inside, the divine matrix of compassion to make all of us.
This is what it looks like, "My mercy is <unk> all the stuff."
This is what it looks like, "My mercy is <unk> about my <unk>
They would all give you the grace of mercy.
Thank you.
I'm here today to talk to you about a similar question that has an equally <unk> answer.
It's about the secrets of domestic violence -- and the question I'm going to address is the one that everybody is doing very well. Why she is left?
Why was someone going to stay with a man who <unk>
I'm not a psychiatrist, no social worker, no master in domestic violence.
I'm just a woman with a story that count.
I was 22 years old. I was just at Harvard University.
I had moved to New York City for my first job as a writer and editor in <unk> magazine.
I had my first apartment, my first green <unk> American <unk> and I had a very big secret.
My secret was that many, many times, the man, that I creates my soul <unk> I would join the head with a <unk> <unk> <unk>
The man who loved one in this world, put a gun into my head and <unk> with <unk> more times as I can remember.
I'm here to tell you the story of <unk> <unk> a psychological trap <unk> of love, where they fall every year, and even some men.
Until it could be his story.
I don't look like a typical survivor of domestic violence.
I'm a <unk> at Harvard University, and I have an MBA at Harvard Business <unk>
I've spent most of my career working for companies on the list of <unk> <unk> between them Johnson & Johnson, Leo <unk> and The Washington <unk>
I've been almost 20 years married with my second husband and we have three children.
My dog is a black <unk> and lead a <unk> <unk> <unk>
So my first message for you is that domestic violence can happen to anyone, all the races, all the religions, all the income levels and education.
It's everywhere.
And my second message is that everybody thinks domestic violence happens to women, which is a problem of women.
Not exactly.
Over 85 percent of the <unk> are men, and domestic abuse is just men, and domestic abuse -- or, in a long way, in families, the last place we want or we expect to find <unk> because domestic abuse is so <unk>
I would have told you that it would be the last person in the world that would be left with a man who took it, and I actually went a very typical victim because of my age.
I was 22 years old, and in the United States women were three times more likely to be victims of domestic violence than the other ages, and the other ages, and over 500 women and girls of that age are killed every year by couples, <unk> and husbands <unk> in the United States.
I also was a typical victim because I knew nothing about domestic violence, their warning signs or their patterns.
I met <unk> in a cold and rainy night in January.
I was sitting on my side in New York City and he started <unk> with me.
He said two things.
The first one was that he had just been <unk> from a college of <unk> <unk> and working on a very important bank of Wall Street.
But what struck me in that first encounter was that it was ready and fun, and that seemed like a field guy.
I had some big <unk> as apples, and a <unk> hair, and it seemed so sweet.
One of the most smart things that made <unk> from the beginning, was to create the illusion that I was the dominant component of mate.
He did about all at the beginning of <unk> in a <unk>
We started coming out and loved all of me, who was ready to come to Harvard who was a passion to help teenage girls and my job.
I wanted to know all about my family, my childhood, my dreams and illusions.
<unk> believed in me, as a writer and as a woman, as nobody had ever done it.
And it was why the title of that <unk> school and the work on Wall Street and his brilliant future had so much relevance to him.
I didn't know that the first phase in any relationship of domestic violence is <unk> and <unk> the victim.
And I didn't know the second step is <unk>
Now, the last thing I wanted to do was I went out of New York to leave the work of my dreams, but I thought I'd be doing sacrifices for your couple, so I thought, I left my job and <unk> and I went together from Manhattan.
I had no idea that it was falling into a <unk> <unk> who was entering a physical trap and financial trap carefully <unk>
The next step in the pattern of domestic violence is to bring the threat of violence to see how it reacts to it.
And here is where those <unk> come in.
As soon as we moved to New England you know, that place where you're supposed to be <unk> I had to feel so safe to get three <unk>
One was in the <unk> of the car.
Another one was held under the pillow in our bed and the third always in his pocket.
And he said that I needed those guns to cause the trauma that they lived with.
I needed them to feel secure.
But those guns were actually a message for me and even though I had never lifted my hand, my life was really serious for every day every day.
The first physical attack of <unk> happened five days before our wedding.
They were the seven in the morning and still had the <unk>
Five days later, when the 10 bruises of my neck had disappeared, I put my mother <unk> and she married him.
Despite what happened was, I was confident that we were living happy forever, because I loved her and he was loved -- and he wanted to be very much.
And I was very, very <unk>
It just felt very <unk> by the wedding and for the fact of making a family with me.
He had been an isolated accident, and it would never make me harm.
I spent two times more on our moon.
The first time I was driving up to a secret beach and he <unk> and he turned to me so strong in the head that I had a lot of times against the <unk> of the car.
And then, a couple of days later, driving back from our moon of honey -- he went through the traffic and threw a Big Mac <unk> to the face.
<unk> followed one or two times a week for the next two and a half years of our marriage.
I was thinking, when I thought it was the only one in this situation.
One of the three American women is a victim of domestic or domestic violence at some point in their life, and the Center for Disease Control, reports that every year 15 million children are <unk> 15 million.
So actually, I had very good company.
To go back to my question: "Why would I <unk>
The answer is straightforward.
I didn't know he was abusing me.
Instead, I was a very strong woman in love with a deeply <unk> man and was the only person in the world who could help <unk> to face their <unk>
The other question that everybody else is doing is: Why do you simply not get <unk>
Why did I not get <unk> I could have been at any time.
So for me this is the saddest and painful question that people do, because us, the victims, we know something that normally you <unk> is incredibly dangerous to abandon a <unk>
Because the last phase in the pattern of domestic violence is <unk>
More than 70 percent of domestic violence in cases of domestic violence occur after the victim has been in order to <unk> because then <unk> has nothing to lose.
Other implications include permanent communication, even after the <unk> has returned to married, <unk> of financial resources, and delivery of the family justice system for <unk> to the victim and their children, who are usually obliged by judges not to spend the man who was going to lead to their mother.
And yet we continue to ask, why is it not going to do it?
I was able to go, because of one last <unk> he would go back to my denial.
I realized that the man who loved so much, I would have killed if it was allowed.
So I broke the silence.
I told my neighbors to the police, to my neighbors, my friends and family, all of strangers, <unk> and I'm here today because all of you are <unk>
We have the trend to <unk> victims like headlines <unk> women -- <unk> goods.
The question, "Why is it <unk>
Some people is a way to say "The fault is yours by <unk> as if the victims <unk> intentionally <unk> of men who want to <unk>
But since I published <unk> <unk> I've heard hundreds of stories of men and women who also have learned that they learned a <unk> lesson from what happened and that we will raise their lives joyful and happy lives like <unk> wives and mothers, fully free violence, like mine.
Because it turns out that I am actually a victim and a survivor of domestic and very typical violence.
I went to marry a cute guy, and we have those three children.
I have that black <unk> and also that <unk>
What I'm not going to go back to have never more, would ever be a loaded gun to my head in the hands of someone who says he wants me.
Right now, they are thinking, <unk> that's <unk> or <unk> which stupid <unk> but all this time I actually have been talking about you.
I assure you that there are a few people who are listening to me right now, that they're being <unk> or they were being <unk> or that they were <unk> themselves.
<unk> could be affecting their daughter, to her sister, their best friend right now.
I was able to end up my crazy love breaking the silence.
And I keep doing this today.
It's my way to help other victims, and it's my last request for you.
Talk about what you've heard here.
The abuse thrives only in silence.
They have the power of ending domestic violence simply throwing light on it.
The victims we need all the world.
We need each of you to understand the secrets of domestic violence.
<unk> the <unk> to the light talking about it with their children, their colleagues and family.
<unk> their vision of survivors as fantastic people and <unk> who have a future <unk>
You know, the early signs of violence in order to slow down their climb and show the victims a safe transmission.
Together we can turn our bed, our tables and our families in the oasis and <unk> they should be.
Thank you.
Hello. I call Cameron <unk> and for a while, I'm a model.
To be <unk> for 10 years ago.
And I feel that at this point there is a little uncomfortable tension in the room because I shouldn't have dressed up like this.  Luckily, I've brought clothes to <unk>
This is the first change of clothing on a <unk> stage, so you have a lot of luck to do, I think.
If some of the women are <unk> when they <unk> they don't have to be able to do it, but to find out later on Twitter.
I also want to point out that I have the privilege of being able to change what about me in just 10 seconds.
Not everybody has that opportunity.
These differences are very <unk> less bad than I don't have to use.
The worst part is going through the head, because it's when you're going to laugh at me, so you don't do anything as it covers me the head.
All right.
Why have I done this?
It's been embarrassing.
Well, I hope that not as much as this picture.
The appearance is powerful, but also <unk>
I've changed totally what I thought about me in six seconds.
And in this picture, I had never had a boyfriend, in real life.
I was totally uncomfortable and the photographer said to me that I would take my back and make the hair <unk>
Of course, except with surgery or an artificial <unk> like the one I did two days for the work, there is very little that we could make it to transform our looks, which, even though shallow and <unk> has a big impact on our lives.
So today, for me, being brave means to be honest.
I'm on this stage because I am a model.
Because I'm a nice woman and white, and in my workforce, that's being a sexy girl.
I'm going to answer the questions that people always do, but in a <unk> way.
The first question is, how does it come to be model?
And I always say, <unk> <unk> but that doesn't mean anything.
The real reason I made a model is because I won the genetic lottery. And I'm the <unk> of an aging and you might be wondering what's this <unk>
Well, in the last centuries we have not only defined the beauty as health, youth and symmetry and symmetry, which we're biologically programmed to <unk> we also have been associated with a high and <unk> shape and <unk> and a white skin.
And that's my heritage <unk> that I've known to use to make money.
And I know there are people in the audience who are now showing <unk> and maybe there are some <unk> of the fashion that are <unk> Hold on.
First of all, <unk> by knowing so much models.
But unfortunately I have to report that in 2007, a Ph.D. student at the University of New York I told each and every one of the models in the <unk> and the <unk> models -- just to say, less than four percent, it wasn't white ...
The next question that people are always doing is: Does it be a model when it's <unk>
And my first answer is: I don't know, I didn't take care of that.
But then, what I would really tell you every one of these girls is: Why? Can you be what you want.
You can be president of the United States, or the <unk> of the next Internet, or a <unk> <unk> ninja and poet, which would be awesome, because you would be the first.
If you go out of this spectacular list, it's still <unk> No, no, Cameron, I want to be a model, then I know I know my <unk>
Because I am not in charge of nothing, and you could be the head of <unk> American magazine or the CEO of <unk> or the next Steven <unk>
To say that you want to be a model to say that you want to win the lottery when you're larger.
It's out of your control, it's amazing, and it's not a job you can choose.
I'm going to show you all that I learned in 10 years as a model, because unlike <unk> surgery can be summarized right now.
I don't know what happened there.
Unfortunately, once you take your studies, and you have a <unk> and you have a <unk> and a <unk> and a little job of your back, no matter what you're going to want to be president of the United States, but your resume has been <unk> <unk> of clothes in 10 years, people would look at you weird.
The next question that people are always doing is if all of the photos are <unk>
And yes, pretty much <unk> all the photos, but that's just a little part of what happens.
This was the first picture that I was told, and also the first time I used a <unk> and I didn't even have my period.
I know we're entering the personal field, but it was a little girl.
This is how I looked at my grandmother a few months earlier.
These two pictures are the same day.
My friend came with me.
Here's a <unk> party a few days before the photos for the French <unk>
Here I am with my football team and in <unk>
And this is me today.
And I hope you'll realize that I'm not me in those photos.
They are creations of a professional group, <unk> <unk> photographers and <unk> and all of their <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and make this.
Well, the next question that people are always doing is: <unk> things for free?
I have too many <unk> heel.
I grew up in Cambridge, and once I went to a shop and I forgot to bring money, and they gave me the dress for free.
When I was a teenager, I was traveling with my friend who was a <unk> <unk> he jumped on a red light and of course, <unk> and <unk> a sorry, agent in order to be able to keep <unk>
<unk> of these privilege -- I mean, I don't mean why I am. And there are people who are paying a price for their appearance no matter who they are.
I live in New York City, and last year, from the teenagers who stood up and <unk> 86 percent were black and Latino -- and most of them were young men.
And there are only <unk> young black and Latino young men in New York, so for them, it's not a question of <unk>
It's about how many times I get <unk> and <unk>
And when I research for this talk, I found that about 53 percent of the girls in 13 years in the United States they don't like their body, and that figure goes up to 78 percent to the 17.
So the last question that people ask me is: How is the life of a model?
And I think the answer that you hope is, if you're a little warmer and you have the brightest hair, you'll feel so happy and beautiful.
And behind the cameras, we give an answer that maybe I would use it.
<unk> It's really wonderful to travel, and also incredible power to work with clever and clever people.
And all of that is true, but it's just a part of what happens, because what we never say in front of the cameras, what I never said in front of them, is: I'm insecure.
And I'm because I have to worry about my life every day.
And if you ever get asked, with some more thin legs and the brightest hair will be more happy?
They only have to meet with a set of models, because they have the <unk> legs -- the brightest hair and the more <unk> but probably the most <unk> women on the planet.
But especially it was difficult to analyze a public racial situation when I am one of the biggest <unk>
If there is something that will hold out of this talk, I hope you all feel more comfortable to recognize the power of the image in the perception of success and failure.
Thank you.
Photography has been my passion since I was older enough to support a camera, but today I want to share with you my 15 <unk> photos and I didn't go to the <unk>
There were no <unk> directors -- no opportunity to repeat the pictures, not even a little bit in the lighting in the lighting.
In fact, most of them took them partial tourists at random.
My story begins when, <unk> in New York City to give a <unk> my wife took me this photo holding my daughter on the day of his first birthday. That's the <unk> corner and five.
He happened that we went back to New York just a year later, so we decided to get the same picture.
Well, you can imagine what comes now.
When I was approaching the third birthday.
So here is when we started asking for the tourists which was going to take us the picture.
It's surprising that the gesture of delivering the camera to a complete stranger is so universal.
No one has never been denied and, fortunately, no one has ever dealt with the camera.
So we weren't aware of how much life would change this journey.
It became something sacred for us.
This picture is a few weeks after the <unk> and I had to explain to my daughter what I had happened that day in a way that a little girl in five years could be understood.
These pictures are much more than representations of a concrete moment or a specific journey.
They're also a way to stop the time in a week of October and to make us reflect on our age and our evolution over the years, and not only at the physical level, but in all the senses.
Because, even though we put the same picture, and our perspective changes, my daughter has a new <unk> and I can see life through their eyes and how they perceive and interact with everything.
That particular time that we spent together is something that we hope with illusion all the year.
Recently, in one of the travel, we were walking around, when all of a sudden he stopped in my tracks and pointed out a red <unk> of the grocery store that <unk> small <unk>
And he described to me what I was at five years of foot in that same place.
<unk> who remembered his heart <unk> with force to see that place for the first time nine years ago.
And now what he looks in New York City is universities, because he's determined to study in New York.
And suddenly I understood that one of the most important things we created are memories.
So I want to share the idea of actively engaging in the conscious creation of memories.
I don't know about you, but aside from these 15 pictures, I don't go out in many of the family pictures.
I'm always the one that brings the picture.
Today I want to encourage you all to come up in the picture, and they didn't go back to someone and asked him, and he brings us a picture?
Thank you.
I'd like to talk to you about a very special group of animals.
There are 10,000 species of birds in the world.
<unk> are in the most <unk> of the <unk>
First of all, why do they have so bad <unk>
It's also been associated with Disney laughter -- <unk> <unk> <unk> characters.
More recently, if you've been following the press <unk> laughter, applause and <unk> these are the attributes that they associate with Parliament -- but I don't accept it.
I don't accept. You know why?
Because the members of Parliament don't keep <unk>  <unk> don't help prevent the spread of disease.
<unk> are <unk>    And so my favorite, the <unk> have better presence.
There are the <unk> in the New World who are mainly in the <unk> like <unk> and <unk> and the <unk> of the World Bank, where we have 16 species of these 16, 11 face a high risk of extinction.
So why are they going to <unk> them in the first place, providing life ecological services <unk>
They're our <unk> natural garbage <unk>
<unk> the carcasses up to the bone.
They help kill all bacteria. They help kill anthrax than it would not be by them, and causing huge loss of livestock and diseases in other animals.
Recent studies have shown that in areas where there are no <unk> the carcasses take three to four times more time in <unk> and this has huge ramifications of the <unk>
<unk> also have enormous historical importance.
They've been associated with old culture <unk>
<unk> was the symbol of the lip and maternity and, along with the <unk> <unk> the unit between High and under Egypt.
In the mythology of <unk> <unk> was the god <unk> and risked his life to save the <unk> <unk> of the Tasmanian <unk>
In <unk> culture, they are doing some very important <unk> to open sky in places like Tibet, there is no place to bury the dead dead, or wood to <unk> so these <unk> provide a natural disposal system.
What is the problem with <unk>
We have eight species of <unk> in Kenya, which six are in extreme <unk>
The reason is that they're being <unk> and the reason they're being <unk> is because there are conflicts between humans and <unk> <unk> communities use this poison against predators, and as a consequence, the <unk> are victims of this.
In South Asia, in countries like India and Pakistan, four species of <unk> are in the critical list of extinction, -- which means that in less than 10 or 15 years old, and the reason is because they fall prey to the consumer consumption that has been treated with a foreign drug like <unk>
This drug has been banned by using veterinarian in India and have taken a statement.
Since there are no <unk> there has been a spread in the number of dogs <unk> in <unk> <unk> and when you have <unk> dogs -- you have a huge bomb bomb, and the number of cases has increased enormously in India.
Kenya is going to have one of the largest wind farms in Africa, <unk> <unk> are going to be up from Lake <unk>
I'm not against wind energy, but we have to work with governments, because wind turbines do this to the birds.
They are <unk>
In West Africa, there's a horrible trade of <unk> dead to serve the <unk> and the <unk> market.
So what are you doing? Well, we're looking at these birds.
We're trying to determine their basic ecology, and see where they go.
We can see that they travel through different countries, so focusing on a living problem is not going to be <unk>
We need to work with governments at the <unk> levels.
We're working with local communities.
We are talking to them about appreciating the <unk> about the need to appreciate these wonderful creatures and services that they <unk>
How can you help? It can become assets, make noise. Can you write a letter to your government and tell you we need to focus on these very <unk> creatures.
When you go out of this room, they will tell you about the <unk> but talk to your families, with their children, with their neighbors about the <unk>
They are very <unk> Charles Darwin said it changed from opinion because he saw them fly without <unk> without energy spending in the heavens.
Kenya, this world, will be much more poor without these wonderful species.
Thank you very much.
Every thing I do and all I do -- my life has been <unk> for seven years of work during my youth in Africa.
From <unk> to <unk> <unk> a young man, but I am not.  I worked in Zambia, Kenya, Coast of <unk> <unk> and Somalia.
I worked for a <unk> NGO and every project that we set up in Sub-Saharan Africa.
And I was <unk>
It was <unk> to the 21, that Italians were good people, and we were doing a good job in Africa.
Instead of that, everything that we would have, all of the things that I would have, the <unk>
Our first project, which inspired my first book, <unk> from <unk> was a project where a few Italians decided to teach people in Zambia to grow food.
So we came up with seeds <unk> south of Zambia to this absolutely amazing valley that descends into the <unk> River, and we teach the local the <unk> tomatoes and <unk> and ...
Of course, people were not at all who were interested in doing that, so they were going to get them to come to work, and some times, they didn't go --  -- we were aware that the local <unk> in so fertile valley, have had no agriculture.
However, instead of asking you how it was possible that we could not do anything, we just said, "Thank God we're here."   <unk> time to save the people in Zambia in the <unk>
And of course, everything in Africa was grown <unk>
We got these magnificent <unk> in Italy, a tomato <unk> would grow this size. In Zambia, to this size.
And we couldn't believe it, we were telling the <unk> "Look how to <unk>
When tomatoes were <unk> <unk> and red at night in the morning, about 200 <unk> came out from the river and ate everything.  And we said to <unk> "Oh my God, <unk>
And the <unk> said, "Yes, that's why we don't have agriculture here --  "Why don't you do it, you will never be <unk>
I thought we were only by Italians <unk> errors in Africa, but then I saw what the Americans, they did -- what the English would do, and after seeing what they were doing, and then to see what they were doing, I felt pretty proud of our project in Zambia.
Because, as you can see, at least we feed the <unk>
<unk> to see the <unk>  <unk> to see the waste that will give them to the <unk> people in Africa.
She wants to read a book, read <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> economist <unk>
The book was published in 2009.
We, Western countries, we have given the African continent two million dollars in the last 50 years.
I'm not going to tell you about the damage that money has <unk>
Just read your book.
<unk> from an African woman -- the damage we've done.
The Westerners are <unk> missionaries <unk> and we treat people just two things: or <unk> or we're <unk>
The two words come from the Latin <unk> <unk> which means <unk>
However, they mean two different things.
<unk> I try to deal with any of a different culture like my kids, "I want you a lot."
<unk> I deal with all of a different culture like my <unk>
So white in Africa are called <unk>
That book gave me a slap in the face -- "I'm little <unk> written by <unk> who said for all economic development, if people don't want to be <unk> <unk> their own.
This should be the first principle of aid.
The first principle of aid is <unk>
This morning, the gentleman who opened this conference was put a cane on the ground, and he said, you can -- you can imagine a city that's not <unk>
I decided to the age of people, and I invented a system called <unk> <unk> where you never start anything, you will never give anyone, but it becomes a <unk> of local passion, the <unk> of the local people who have the dream of becoming a better person.
So what do you do? They were <unk>
It never comes to a community with an idea, and you sit with the people of the <unk>
We don't work from offices.
We got together in a coffee room, we came up with a bar.
We have zero infrastructure.
And what do we do? We become friends, and we found what the person wants to do.
The most important thing is passion.
And you can give a idea to somebody.
If that person doesn't want to do that, what's going to do you?
The passion that she has for its own growth is the most important thing.
The passion that man has for their own personal growth is the most important thing.
And then, we helped them find knowledge because nobody in the world can be successful alone.
The person with the idea may not have knowledge, but knowledge is available.
So years and years ago, I had this idea: Why not we get to a community instead of getting to a community to tell people what to do, why not do it for once, but not in their community meetings.
I will tell you a secret.
There's a problem with community meetings.
The entrepreneurs will never come back, and they will never tell you in a public meeting, what they want to do with their own money, what opportunity have they <unk>
So, planning has this point.
The most smart people in their community, you don't even know it, because they don't take their public <unk>
What do we do? We work one to one, and we work face-to-face -- you have to create a social infrastructure -- which doesn't exist.
You must create a new profession.
The profession is the family physician in the company, the family family physician who sets up with you at your house, on the kitchen table, and that helps you find the resources to transform their passion in a way of a living.
I started this as a test in <unk> city.
I was doing a Ph.D. at that time, trying to get away from this condescending junk where we get to tell you what to do.
In a year, I had 27 projects going on, and the government came to me to see to ask: "How can you do that?
How can you do it?" And I said, "I did something very, very hard.
And so --   So the government says, <unk> <unk> <unk>  We've done it in 300 communities in the world.
We've helped to start 40,000 businesses.
There's a new generation of entrepreneurs who are dying of loneliness.
Peter <unk> One of the greatest business <unk> of history, passed away in '96, a few years ago.
Peter <unk> was a professor professor before I was involved in business, and this is what Peter <unk> says, <unk> is actually incompatible with a society and a company <unk>
<unk> is the kiss of the death of the <unk>
So now <unk> reconstructing <unk> without knowing what the most <unk> people in <unk> want to do with their own money and their own energy.
You have to learn how to get these people to talk to you.
You have to offer you your privacy, you have to be fantastic to the <unk> and then <unk> will come in mass.
In a community of 10,000 people, we get 200 customers.
You can imagine a community of 400,000 people and intelligence and passion?
What about you here have been <unk> this tomorrow?
Local <unk> That's what you have <unk>
So what I tell you is that the entrepreneurial spirit is where it is.
We're at the end of the first industrial revolution -- the fossil revolution -- the fossil revolution -- and from one moment to another, we have systems that are not sustainable.
The internal combustion engine is not sustainable.
<unk> as a way of holding <unk> is not sustainable.
What we have to consider, is how we <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> to seven billion people, in a sustainable way.
There are no technologies to do it.
Who is going to invent the technology for the green revolution, <unk> <unk>
The government?
They'll be entrepreneurs and they're doing it now.
There is a beautiful story that in a research magazine many, many years ago.
There was a group of experts who were invited to debate the future of New York City in the year <unk>
And in the year <unk> they got together this group of people -- and they were <unk> about what would happen to New York City in 100 years, and the conclusion was <unk> New York City wouldn't exist within 100 years.
Why? Because they looked at the curve and <unk> if the population is growing up to this <unk> to move to the population of New York to the <unk> <unk> six million horses, and the manure produced by six million horses that would be impossible to address.
They were already <unk> in dung.  And so, in <unk> they were <unk> this dirty technology that <unk> New York City.
So what happens? Over the next 40 years, in 1900, in the United States there were <unk> generic companies <unk>
And the idea of finding a different technology was absolutely <unk> and there were very few days, <unk> factories at <unk> places.
<unk> Michigan. Henry Ford.
But there is a secret to work with entrepreneurs.
First, you have to offer them <unk>
Otherwise they won't come to talk to you.
Then you have to give you an absolute <unk> dedicated <unk>
And then you will have to tell you the truth about <unk>
The smallest company, the biggest company, the biggest company has to be able to do three things -- the product that you want to sell is to be fantastic, you have to tell with a fantastic marketing and you have to have a fantastic financial administration.
Do you know what?
We've never met a single human being in the world that can be done, to sell and look for the money alone.
It doesn't exist.
This is not born.
We have looked at and observed 100 companies from the Carnegie <unk> <unk> <unk> Ford, all the new companies -- <unk> <unk>
There's only one thing that all successful companies in the world have in common -- only one: no one was started by one person.
And the word <unk> but the word <unk> 32 times.
He wasn't just when it began.
No one begins a company alone.
So, we can create the community where we have <unk> who come from a small business environment <unk> in <unk> in the <unk> next to their dedicated psychiatrists, who will do for you, what someone did by this gentleman who talks about this <unk> someone who would ask you, what need you need?
What can you? Can you do that?
Well, you can <unk> it can look for the <unk>
"Oh, no, I can't do that."
We activate communities.
Thank you.
Those around us can help us from many ways to improve our lives.
We don't know all the neighbors -- that's why we don't really do a lot of knowledge despite sharing the same public spaces.
In the last few years, I've tried to share more with my neighbors in public space, with simple tools like <unk> templates and chalk.
These projects came from questions like, how much do my neighbors pay for their <unk>
How can we pay and borrow more things without calling the door to a bad moment?
How do I share more memories of our abandoned buildings and understand our <unk>
How do you share more of our hopes to cows and cows so that our communities can reflect our needs and <unk>
I live in New York City, and I'm in love with New <unk>
My soul always finds relief with the giant wild who give shadow to <unk> <unk> and <unk> for centuries and I trust a city.
And there is a <unk> in New York   The city has one of the most beautiful architecture of the world, but also one with the most beautiful number of American <unk>
I live close to this house, and I thought it could turn it into a <unk> space for the neighborhood and also in something that changed my life forever.
In 2009 I lost someone who loved a lot.
It was <unk> as a mother to <unk>
His death was sudden and it was unexpected.
I thought a lot about death and so much.
And this was a profound gratitude for the time and lived in time.
He gave the significant things in my current life.
But let's try to keep this look in my everyday life.
It seems to me that it's easy to be able to catch up the day and forget the really important thing for you.
So with the help of old and new friends transformed the wall of this left house on a giant board and painted on her phrases for <unk> "Before they die <unk>
So, <unk> could take a <unk> reflect on their lives and personal aspirations in public space.
I didn't know what this experiment is, but the next day the wall was full and still <unk>
And I'd like to share some things that people wrote on the wall.
Before I die I want to be <unk> by <unk>  "Before I want to sit at <unk> on the line of <unk>
"Before I want to sing I want to sing to millions of people."
Before I die I want to plant a <unk>
"Before I want to live outside of the <unk>
"Before I want to die I want to spend once more."
"Before I want to go to the bailout of <unk>
"Before I want to be completely myself."
This abandoned space became <unk> and the dreams and the hopes of people who made me laugh at <unk> and they gave me comfort in hard times.
It's about knowing that you're not alone. It's about understanding our neighbors in new and new ways -- it's trying to accommodate the reflection and the <unk> and remember what is most important to us as we grow and <unk>
This happened last year and started getting hundreds of messages of passionate people who wanted to make a wall in their community.
And so with my colleagues in the civic center we did a kit, and now they've been made walls in countries around the world, like <unk> South Africa, Australia, Argentina and beyond.
And together we showed the power of our public spaces if you give us the opportunity to express ourselves and share each other.
Two of the most valuable things we have is time and our relationships with other people.
In our era, it's more important than ever before, to find the ways to keep your perspective and remember that life is brief and very sensitive to it.
Death is something that we often avoid talking about, or even thinking, but I understood that preparing for death is one of those things that will be more power.
And if you think about death, we have our life.
Our shared spaces can reflect better what we care like individuals and as a community and with more to share hope, fears and stories, the people that surrounds us, not only can help improve places, can help improve our lives.
Thank you.
Thank you.
I have a single request.
Please don't tell me that I'm normal.
Now I'd like to introduce you to my siblings.
<unk> is 22 years old, and it's very <unk>
We're not talking about, but it makes joy better than some of the best speakers.
<unk> knows what love.
<unk> shares what happens.
It's not <unk> You don't look at the color of the skin.
It doesn't matter of religious differences and look at it, it's never <unk>
When we sing our childhood, trying to tell the words that I didn't even know -- I could remember one thing: how little we know about the mind and how wonderful it must be the unknown.
Samuel He's 16 years old. It's very <unk>
<unk> the <unk> memory.
But it's a selective memory.
It didn't remember if I stole my <unk> but it reminds me of the year where every single songs came out of my iPod, conversations that we kept when I was four years old, I would be able to pee on my arm during the first episode of the <unk> and the Lady of Lady <unk>
It doesn't seem amazing?
But most people disagree with it.
And in fact, because their minds don't fit into the concept of normal society, often they're <unk> and <unk>
But what it propelled my heart and <unk> my soul was that even if that was the case, even though you wouldn't consider it inside of it, that would only mean one thing that they were <unk> autistic and extraordinary.
Now, for those less familiar with the term <unk> is a complex brain disorder that affects social communication, learning and sometimes the physical skills.
In each individual it manifests itself in a different form of a different way, and it will be so different to Sam.
And all over the world, every 20 minutes, is being diagnosed with a new case of autism, and even though it's one of the disorders of development that faster in the world, there's no cause or <unk>
I don't remember my first encounter with autism, but I don't remember one day without him.
I had only three years when my brother came to the world, and I was very excited to have a new way to be in my life.
When you spent a few months, I realized that he was different.
<unk> a lot.
I didn't want to play like the other babies -- and in fact, it didn't seem very interested in me at all.
<unk> lived and <unk> in their own world, with their own rules, and I would find pleasure in the smallest things, like putting cars in row around the room, looking at the washing machine, and eat anything that would have <unk>
As it was growing up, it got more different, and the differences were made more evident.
But beyond the <unk> the frustration and the frustration and the <unk> <unk> there was something really <unk> a pure nature and innocent nature -- a child who sees the world without <unk> a human who had never been <unk>
<unk>
I can't deny that there have been some tough moments in my family, moments in which I wish I would have been fair like me.
But I look back at the things that have taught me about individuality, and communication and love, and I realize that they're things that wouldn't want to change by normal.
<unk> happens by high the beauty that gives us the differences and the fact of being different doesn't mean that any one is wrong.
It just means there's a different view of what's right.
If I could <unk> one single thing to <unk> and Sam and you would be that they don't have to be normal.
They can be extraordinary.
Because, autistic or not, the differences that <unk> are a <unk> Every one of us has a gift in your inner interior, and honestly, the search for normal is the ultimate sacrifice of potential.
The opportunity for <unk> progress and the change is dying at the time we try to be like others.
You don't want to tell me that I'm normal.
Thank you.
Five years ago, I experienced a little bit of what it must have been <unk> in the country of <unk>
Penn State asked me to me, a trained teacher to give a kind of communication to students of engineering.
I was scared.  <unk> really <unk> of these students with their great minds, their great books and the unknown words.
But when those conversations, I felt what would have felt like when he fell through the hole in the <unk> and saw the door of a new world.
I just felt like I had those conversations with the students, I was surprised the ideas that they had, and I wanted others to experience this wonderful world.
And I think the key to opening that door is a great communication.
We really need a great communication of our scientists and engineers in order to change the world.
Our scientists and engineers are the ones that are attacking our biggest challenges -- from energy to the environment and care of health care, and if we don't know about this, the work is not done, and I think it's our responsibility as not scientists to have these interactions.
But these big conversations cannot happen if our scientists and engineers are not invited to see their wonderful world.
So scientists and engineers, please, <unk> with <unk>
I want to share some suggestions on how you can do it to make sure that their science is sexy and that their engineering is attractive.
First question for <unk> and then what?
So why science is relevant to us.
You don't just tell you that we study the <unk> but study the <unk> that are the mesh structure of our bones because it's important to understand and treat <unk>
And when you're describing your science, care about <unk>
<unk> is an obstacle to our understanding of their ideas.
Sure, you can say <unk> and <unk> but why not say <unk> and <unk> which is much more accessible to us?
<unk> <unk> is not the same thing they do stupid things.
Instead, as Einstein, said everything as simple as possible, but not simple.
They can communicate with clearly your science without compromise the ideas.
One thing to consider is to use examples, stories and analogies. They are ways to turn and engage with their content.
And by presenting their work, forget about signs of <unk>
Have you asked why they call <unk>  What do you do the <unk> <unk> are killed and <unk> your presentation.
A <unk> like this is not only boring, but it's <unk> too much in the language area of our brain and we will get <unk>
Instead, this <unk> of <unk> <unk> is much more effective, it shows that the special structure of <unk> is so strong that really inspired the only one of the only Tower <unk>
The trick here is to use a simple, <unk> phrase that the public can understand if you lose a little bit, and then provide graphs that will empower our other senses and create a deeper sense of understanding what they are going to get.
I think these are just some key ones that can help the other open door and see the country of the wonders that is science and engineering.
And so, scientists and engineers, when you've solved this equation, by all the media, <unk> with <unk>  Thank you.
One of my favorite words from all the Oxford English Oxford is <unk>
Just because it sounds very good.
And <unk> means <unk> <unk>
Even though there was an editor in the 19th century that defined it a lot better when he said, "A <unk> is the one who looks for a public charge, no matter or start, and that when he won, it gets for the mere use of monumental <unk> <unk>
I have no idea what it means is <unk>
Something to do with words I guess.
It's very important that words are the basis in politics, and that all politicians know they have to try to master the language.
It wasn't <unk> for example, that the British Parliament allowed newspapers to quote the exact words that were said in the <unk> camera.
And all of this was because of the bravery of a guy with the unusual name of <unk> <unk> who faced the <unk>
He brought him in the London Tower and <unk> him, but he had enough courage to face them, and at the end, he had such popular support in London that I won.
And only a few years later, we had the first <unk> of the phrase <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> like the <unk>
Most of you think it's literal <unk>
It's not. It's for a advocate of freedom of expression.
But to show you really how words and politics interact, I want you to go back to America, just after independence.
So, they had to address the question of how to call George Washington, his leader.
They didn't know it.
How do you call the leader of a <unk>
This is happening in Congress for a long time.
They were introduced all kinds of suggestions that might be <unk>
Some of them wanted to call it the <unk> of State <unk> and others, "Your <unk> George <unk> and other <unk> from the <unk> of the U.S. <unk>
Not very <unk>
Some of them wanted to call it <unk>
They thought it was <unk> quality.
And they were not even with it -- they had the idea that you could be chosen by King for a fixed term.
And I could have <unk>
Everyone got tired <unk> because this debate was <unk> for three weeks.
I read the newspaper of a poor <unk> and always <unk> <unk> with this <unk>
What caused <unk> and <unk> was that the House House was against <unk>
The House didn't want Washington to be <unk> of power.
They didn't want to call him King for if they did it or his <unk> ideas.
So they wanted to give the <unk> <unk> <unk> and more unfortunate title that they had happened.
And that title was <unk>
President. They didn't invent the title. There was only before, but it just meant <unk> that <unk> a <unk>
It was like the president of a jury.
And I didn't have much more <unk> than the term <unk> or <unk>
There were <unk> presidents of small <unk> <unk> and <unk> -- but it was really a <unk> title.
And that's why the Senate <unk>
They said, "It's ridiculous, we can't call it <unk>
"This guy has to sign treated and <unk> with <unk> <unk>
"And who is going to take a serious title with a title and <unk> like President of <unk>
And finally, after three weeks of debate, the Senate didn't survive.
We can learn three interesting things about this.
First of all, and this is my favorite to where I've been able to figure out, the Senate has never been <unk> as I was the title of President.
President Barack Obama was lucky enough to follow there, waiting for the Senate in action.
The second thing we can learn is that when a government says that a measure is <unk>  <unk> possible to keep waiting for <unk> years.
But the third thing we can learn, and this is the most important thing, and this is the most important thing, and this is the title of President of America doesn't sound at all so modest today, right?
Especially if you have more than 5,000 nuclear warheads at note, the largest economy of the world and a fleet of air vehicles and so on.
The reality and the story have come to the title of <unk>
So I won the <unk>
They got their title of <unk>
And also the other concern in the Senate, the appearance of <unk> well, it was a uniqueness then.
But you know how many nations have now <unk>
And everything because they want to sound like the guy who has the 5,000 nuclear warheads and so on.
So at the end, the Senate won and the House of Representatives <unk> because no one is going to feel humble when you tell you that now are the President of <unk>
And I think that's the great lesson that we can learn, and what I'd like to do with you <unk>
The politicians are trying to choose and use the words to shape and control reality, but actually change change much more words than what these might change reality.
Thank you very much.
I'm 45 feet underwater in a illegal mine in Ghana.
The air is loaded with heat and dust and it's hard to breathe.
I feel the touch of body bodies in the dark, but I can't see much more.
I hear voices that speak but mostly of all, that cacophony of <unk> male <unk> and stones with the tools primitive.
As the rest of you, I carry a cheap flashlight of light <unk> he held his head with this <unk> <unk> and I can barely tell the <unk> branches that hold the walls of that subway hole that falls hundreds of feet on the ground.
It was <unk> my hand and suddenly I remember a mining that I met days before, who lost control and dropped countless feet into that hole.
As I talk to you today, these men are deep in that hole in the hole to risk their lives without paying a reward and, often, dying.
I went out of that hole and I went home, but they probably never will.
In the last 28 years, I was documenting native cultures in more than 70 countries, in the middle of 2009, in 2009, I had the great honor of being the only <unk> in the Peace <unk>
Among all the incredible people I met there I met a <unk> <unk> the <unk> an NGO who has been to eradicate modern slavery.
We started talking about slavery and really, I started learning about slavery because I knew that there was in the world but not about the grade.
When we ended up talking to me I was very sorry to honestly I was feeling very <unk> this <unk> of our days and I thought, if I don't know, how many people don't know?
I got rid of me, the stomach and weeks later, I flew in Los Angeles to meet the director of <unk> the <unk> and offer my help.
So I started my journey to modern slavery.
Interestingly, I had been in many of these places.
Some of them, even considered my second home.
But this time, <unk> the dirty <unk>
A conservative calculation says that there are currently over 27 million people in the world.
It's twice as much displaced the amount of Africans displaced by the whole of slaves <unk>
150 years ago, the cost of a farmer per farmer was about three times the annual wage of an American worker.
The equivalent of a few <unk> of the <unk>
However, today, you can enslaving families by generations for generations of <unk>
Amazingly, slavery generates profit from over <unk> billion dollars a year around the world.
Many have been <unk> with false promises of good education and better work to then find out that they're forced to work without pay, under threat violence and cannot escape.
Today slavery operates in <unk> the goods produced by slaves have value, but who produce them are disposable people.
slavery exists in most of the world, and yet, it's illegal around the world.
In India and Nepal, I met the bricks.
This strange show and <unk> was like entering the old Egypt or the <unk> of <unk>
<unk> on a temperature of 54 degrees -- men, women, children, in fact, families made entire families <unk> in a <unk> <unk> soft <unk> bricks in their head, to 18 at the time, and take them from the <unk> <unk> to trucks that are at hundreds of meters.
<unk> by <unk> and <unk> they work in silence, doing this task, and again for 16 or 17 hours a day.
There was no cup to eat, not to drink, and the severe <unk> made it just like <unk>
So <unk> was the heat and the dust that my camera became too hot, and he stopped working.
Every 20 minutes I had to run the car to clean up the team and make it work with air conditioning to <unk> and, sitting there, I was thinking, my camera gets a lot better treatment than these people.
Back in the furnaces I wanted to cry but the <unk> that I was on my side and he quickly grabbed me and said, "You don't do it. Don't do it here."
And he explained to me very clearly making emotions very dangerous in places like this, not only for me but for them.
I couldn't give you any direct help.
I couldn't give you money, nothing.
I wasn't a citizen of that country.
I could put them in a worse situation that they already were.
I had to rely on <unk> the <unk> and working inside the system for his release and trusted that I was doing it.
In terms of me, I waited to get home to feel my heart <unk>
In the Himalayas I found kids carrying stones for miles on <unk> <unk> to trucks they were waiting down.
Those great <unk> were more heavy than the children who load them and the children would put them into their heads with <unk> <unk> made of <unk> ropes and <unk>
It's hard to witness something so <unk>
How can we influence something so <unk> but so <unk>
Some people don't even know that they are slaves and work 16 or 17 hours a day without <unk> because this has been this whole life.
They have nothing with what to <unk>
When these villagers migrated their freedom, the <unk> had completely <unk>
When you hear the word slavery often we think about sexual traffic and because of this global consciousness advised me that it would be difficult to me to work with security in this particular business.
In <unk> I was <unk> women who had been previously served with sex.
It took me by a few stairs <unk> that gave this <unk> basement <unk> <unk>
It wasn't exactly a <unk>
It was a restaurant.
<unk> as it is known in the craft, they're local to prostitution prostitution for prostitution itself.
They have small rooms with small rooms where <unk> <unk> with their girls and children, some of just seven years -- are forced to entertain customers and <unk> to buy more food and alcohol.
Each is dark and <unk> identified by a number painted on the wall and divided by a <unk> and a curtain.
The workers often suffer sexual abuse of their customers.
On the <unk> I remember a sense of <unk> <unk> and in that instant, I could barely imagine what it should be stuck in that hell.
I just had a <unk> the stairs where he <unk>
There was no <unk> doors.
There were no windows big enough to <unk>
Those people don't have <unk> and, because we touch a very difficult subject, it's important to point out that slavery even sex is happening around us.
There are hundreds of people living in agriculture, <unk> in the domestic service, and the list can continue.
Recently, the New York Times reported that between 100,000 and 300,000 American children are sold every year as sex slaves every year as well.
This is everywhere, but we don't see it.
<unk> are another activity that often interacting with the labor of artwork.
I went to Indian villages where there were Indian families in the trade of the silk.
This is a family.
The black hands are the father, the <unk> of blue and red, of their children.
<unk> <unk> in these big barrels and <unk> silk in the liquid to the <unk> but the <unk> is <unk>
My translator told me their stories.
We don't have <unk> they said.
And you still hope without being able to go out of this house someday and go to another place where we really pay for our job."
It's estimated that there are more than 4,000 children in the Lake <unk> the largest artificial lake in the world.
When we arrived, I went to get a quick look.
I saw what seemed to be a <unk> family in a boat, two older siblings -- some young kids, and it makes sense, right?
<unk> They were all slaves.
Children are separated from their <unk> families, and they were forced to work <unk> in these boats on the lake, even though they don't know swimming.
This boy is eight years old.
When our boat came up to me was <unk> that his little canoe was <unk>
He was paralyzed by the fear of falling to water.
The <unk> branches of the trees plunged into the lake <unk> often trap networks and children, <unk> and with fear, they become water to release the branches.
A lot of <unk>
Since remember, it's always been forced to work in the lake.
For fear of his love is not going to flee and like all life has been treated with cruelty, <unk> tries to the younger slaves under their charge.
I met these guys at five in the morning, when they were <unk> the last networks, but they had been working from one of the time.
On the cold night and <unk>
And I would point out that these networks weigh over 400 pounds when they're packed with fish.
I want to introduce you to <unk>
Kofi was rescued in a village of fishermen.
I met him in a shelter where I was <unk> the <unk> <unk> victims of slavery.
Kofi symbolizes as possible.
Who will come to be because someone decided to make a difference in your life?
They took a highway in Ghana with <unk> partners the <unk> a fellow <unk> with his motorcycle <unk> and <unk> our car suddenly accelerated and <unk> our window.
And he asked us to take it through an land road to the jungle.
At the end of the way, we were able to get away from the car, and asked the driver to come out very quickly.
And then you pointed out this path barely visible and said, "This is the path, this is the path.
And as we started down, we removed the <unk> that <unk> the way and after walking about an hour and we found that the way was <unk> by the recent <unk> so I put the pictures of photos on my head as they were <unk> in these water to the chest.
After two hours of <unk> the way ended up <unk> in one of course, and we had a mass of holes that could fit into a football field and everybody was full of <unk> workers.
A lot of women had children attached to their back and while they were looking for gold gold, <unk> in water <unk>
<unk> is used in the process of <unk>
These miners are <unk> in a well in another part of Ghana.
When they came out of the well, they were <unk> in your own sweat.
I remember looking at his eyes tired, <unk> because many of them had been under land for 72 hours.
The wells have to 90 feet and these people carry out heavy heavy bags that then will be transported to another area where they were going to be able to extract the gold.
In the first view, the site seems to be filled strong strong men and <unk> but if you look more close to the margin we see to work at some other lucky and also children.
They're all victims of injuries, and violence.
In fact, it's very likely that this <unk> ended up like this victim of tuberculosis and <unk> for <unk> in a few years.
This is <unk> when his father died, his uncle took him to work with him in the mines.
When they die their uncle, <unk> inherit the debt of the uncle that force to be slave in the mines.
When I met her, I was working on the 14-year-old mines and the leg injury that you see here is a product of an accident in the <unk> so severe that the doctors said it should be <unk>
In addition to that, <unk> has tuberculosis and, yet that is forced to work night and day in that mine.
Even so, he dream with being liberated and <unk> with local activists like <unk> the <unk> and it's this kind of determination, of face to a remote, that's a lot of respect.
I want to throw light on slavery.
Did you know that their images would be seen by you all over the world.
I wanted to know that we will give us testimony to them and we're going to do everything in order to help change their lives.
I really believe that if we can see ourselves each other as human beings, then it becomes very difficult to tolerate atrocities like slavery.
These images are not from magazines. They're people, real people, like you and like me, who deserve the same rights, dignity and respect in their lives.
There is no day that I'm going to think about these so many beautiful people, <unk> that I've had the great honor to know.
And I hope these images end up a force in which you see them in people like you, and I hope that force turn on a fire and that fire makes light on slavery because, without that light, the beast of slavery can continue to live in the shadows.
Thank you very much.
I make math mathematical math and there's a peculiar problem for whom we are, we're like the handling media.
Nobody knows what the hell we do.
So I'm going to try to explain to you what I do.
Dance is one of the most human activities.
We were <unk> the <unk> and the dancers of <unk>  to see more forward.
But the phrase demands a degree of extraordinary training -- a high level of skill and probably some initial <unk> that you can have a genetic component.
Unfortunately, the neurological disorders like Parkinson's disease, destroy this extraordinary ability as it does with my friend <unk> <unk> who, at his time was a wonderful ballet dancer boy.
In the last few years, it has been a lot of progress in the treatment.
However, there are <unk> millions of people in the world who are sick, and they have to deal with a <unk> <unk> <unk> and other symptoms of this disease, so we need <unk> tools to detect the disease before it is too late.
We need to be able to measure progress in a objective and objective progress and ultimately, the only way we will know if there is actually a cure to be when we have an objective and objective and <unk>
But it's frustrating that for Parkinson's and other disorders of the movement there are no biological markers, so they don't have any blood analysis and the best we have is a neurological <unk> for 20 minutes.
You have to go to a clinic doing it. It's very, very expensive, and that means that, out of the clinical trials, they never do.
What if patients could do it at home?
That would save a <unk> trip to the clinic -- what if patients could be done by the test of ourselves?
It wouldn't be personal.
By the way, it costs about 300 dollars in the <unk> clinic.
And so what I want to do is that I want to do it as no conventional way to try, you see, in a certain sense at least we are all <unk> like my friend <unk> <unk>
This is a video of the vibration of vibrating strings.
It shows someone healthy as it emits sounds like this, we can imagine how to speak. We can imagine as a word of a vocal <unk> because we have to coordinate all those vocal organs to produce sounds and we all have the genes needed. The <unk> for example.
And as the man requires an extraordinary training level.
Let's think about time that takes a child to learn how to speak.
From sound, we can track the position of the vocal strings as <unk> and as Parkinson's disease affects the <unk> it also affects the <unk> organs.
On the bottom of the bottom you can see an example of the irregular <unk> of vibrating strings.
We see the same <unk>
Do you get <unk> and <unk>
The speech becomes more quiet and <unk> after a while, and this is an example of symptoms.
How do you compare these tests based on the voice with the <unk> clinical trials -- well, they're both not <unk>
The neurological test is not <unk> they both use existing infrastructure.
You don't need to design a whole series of hospitals to make them.
They both are <unk> OK, but in addition to the testing of voice are not <unk>
I mean, they can be <unk>
They do very quickly, take about 30 seconds as a lot.
These are the minimum cost and we all know what happens.
When something takes a lot of cost so <unk> it appears to a massive scale.
These are some incredible goals to <unk>
We can reduce the hard <unk> of patients.
I would not have to go to the clinic for a pregnancy <unk>
<unk> <unk> we could get goals.
We could make <unk> mass cost for clinical trials and for the first time, <unk> <unk> on a general scale.
We have the opportunity to start looking for the first <unk> of the disease before it's too late.
So the first steps today, the first steps in that sense, are actually launching the Parkinson's disease.
Along with <unk> and <unk> we want to register a lot of voices around the world to collect enough data and start to address these goals.
We have local <unk> local lines for 750 million people in the world.
<unk> with no disease, you can call it under the price and leave recordings of a while, and I'm pleased to announce that we've already reached six percent of the goal in only eight hours.
Thank you.   Tom Rielly: So I said, taking all of these samples of, say, 10,000 people, you can be able to say who's good and who isn't it?
What will you take from these <unk>
Max <unk> Yeah, yeah. What happens is that during the call you got to indicate whether or not the disease. Yeah.
<unk> You see, some people can not <unk> you may not get it.
But we're going to get a very big sample of data <unk> in different circumstances, and do it in different circumstances, it's important because we're looking for <unk> the confusion factors in pursuit of the actual markers of the disease.
TR: Do you have a accuracy of accuracy at this moment?
<unk> Much more than that.
Actually, my graduate student -- I have to have <unk> has done a fantastic job, and now it has shown that works in the mobile phone network, as well, what the project is, now we have 99 percent accuracy.
TR: <unk> and nine. Well, it's better.
<unk> Of course.
TR: Thank you very much. Max public <unk>
<unk> Thank you, <unk>
Before March 2011, I was doing <unk> <unk> in New York City.
We are <unk> creatures.
We were focusing on the dark in the dark, no windows and usually, we avoid sunlight.
We do the <unk> models still more perfect -- the perfect skin is still more perfect, and we can get it in the press all the time, but some of us are really artists with a lot of <unk> with many years of experience and a real taste of images and photography.
On March 11, 2011, I saw from my house, just like the rest of the world, the <unk> events that were happening in Japan.
Soon as long later, an organization where I was <unk> there was <unk> <unk> was in the place working as part of the <unk> team.
I, along with hundreds of other volunteers we knew that we couldn't stay sitting at home, so I decided to join the group for three weeks.
On May I traveled to <unk>
It's a little <unk> village in the <unk> of almost 50,000 people, one of the first villages affected by wave <unk>
The water level reached more than 24 feet high, and over three miles land inside.
As you can imagine, the village was <unk>
<unk> rubble from channels and <unk>
<unk> schools, we removed the mud and we leave the houses ready to be <unk> and <unk>
We took tons and tons of dead, <unk> <unk> from the local factory.
We were telling us and they loved it.
For weeks, both volunteers like the neighbors are found similar things.
They found photos and shots of photos and cameras and cameras and cards.
They all did the same thing.
<unk> and bring them to different places in the villages around the <unk>
It wasn't until then I realized that those pictures represented a huge part of the personal losses that people had <unk>
As they were fleeing the wave, and to save their lives, they had to leave absolutely everything they had.
At the end of my first week I started to help in a center of <unk> of the people.
It helped clean up the <unk> big, giant <unk>
This place turned out to be the place of the people where the center of <unk> <unk> the photos.
And so I took them and I had the honor that that day <unk> in me to clean up the photos.
This was exciting and inspiring, had heard the expression to think beyond the <unk> but it wasn't until I went beyond my horizons that something happened.
When you look at the pictures, I found some that had more than a hundred years old, a few of them were still in the lab -- how to fix that <unk> how to fix that <unk> and repair that <unk> and knew hundreds of people who could do the same.
So that night I got on Facebook contacted some of them, and the next morning the answer was so overwhelming and positive -- that I knew we had to try.
So we started <unk> the photos.
This was the first of all.
It wasn't too <unk> but where the water had <unk> the face of the girl had <unk> with a lot of precision and <unk>
Otherwise that little girl would not have the aspect of it, and that would be so tragic as having the photo <unk>
Over time, they came up with more photos, and it took more photos, and it took more <unk> and then I went back to Facebook and <unk> and five days later, 80 people were offered to help.
After two weeks I had 150 people from <unk>
In Japan, in July, we're going to give you a <unk> people in the north of <unk>
Once we use this week, we use our scanner in the <unk> libraries that had <unk> where people were going to reclaim their photos.
The time that <unk> in <unk> is a different story, depends on of course the <unk> of the photos.
It could be an hour. Could it be a few weeks.
It could be months.
This <unk> he had to draw through hand using a guide the areas whose color and detail had no <unk>
It took a long time.
The water destroyed all of these pictures turned into saltwater, covered in bacteria, with algae, even with <unk> all of it along with the time of time, I continue to <unk> that <unk> was a major part of the project.
We couldn't afford this picture unless I was clean, dry and been <unk> by his <unk>
We were lucky with <unk>
We have a <unk> <unk>
It's very easy to hurt even more the pictures already <unk>
As a time he said, the leader of my group is like making a tattoo.
You can't make mistakes.
The woman brought us these pictures was lucky in relation to the photos.
He had begun to <unk> her themselves but stopped to realize that it would take them even more.
I also had <unk>
Without them, the images of their husband and their own face would not have been able to <unk> we were able to break the images into a single picture and <unk> the whole picture.
When they picked up their pictures shared some of his story with us.
A few colleagues of his husband found the photos in a fire station between the rubble pretty far away from where he used to be his house, but his colleagues would take it.
The day of the tsunami, her husband was the experimenter to close the barriers to the wave to the wave.
He had to go inside the water as the <unk> <unk>
Their young children, not as small now, but their two children were in school, in different schools.
One of them was caught in the water.
He took her a week to find his family and knowing that everybody had survived.
The day I gave her pictures his little little time I was 14.
For her, despite all this, those pictures were the best gift I could <unk> something that he could go back to look, something that he could remember from the past that didn't have been marked by that day in March when everything in his life changed or was destroyed.
After six months in Japan 1,100 volunteers had joined them, and hundreds of them were helped us to clean hand over <unk> photographs -- the great <unk> -- the vast majority of their <unk> <unk>
More than 500 volunteers around the world helped us bring back 90 families and hundreds of completely <unk> and <unk>
During this time, we really don't spend a lot of <unk> in teams and materials, most of the ink in the <unk>
We took pictures all the time.
A picture is a memory of someone or something, a relationship, someone loved it.
They are <unk> of our memories and stories, the last thing we would bring to look for.
This was the project of restore small pieces of humanity, to give someone their connection to the past.
When a photo is coming back to somebody, it's a huge difference in the life of the person that receives it.
This project also made a big difference in the life of <unk>
Some of them connected something larger, to give something, using their talent to something that is not perfect perfect skin models.
So to finish this email I'd like to read this email -- he sent him Cindy day that I came back from Japan after six months.
While I was able to avoid thinking about people and the stories shown in the images.
One particular one, a photo with women of different ages from the grandmother to the small girl, gathering around a baby, <unk> because a little picture of my family -- my grandmother, my mother, my grandmother, and my newborn daughter hangs on our wall.
In the whole world, in all of our basic needs are themselves, right?
Thank you.  <unk>
<unk> <unk> inspired us wonder and curiosity with this picture of a bullet that goes through an apple in an exhibition of just one millionth of a second.
But now, 50 years later, we can go a million times faster and see the world not a million or a billion frames per second.
I present to you a new kind of <unk> <unk> a new technique that can create video in slow light into motion.
And with that, we can create cameras that can see after the <unk> of the line of vision, or see the interior of the body without the X-ray and the <unk> and challenge the camera idea.
If I take a laser pointer and switch it off, and you get it into a <unk> of a second or so, in various <unk> to create a little bit of photons <unk> just a millimeter long.
And that package of photons, that <unk> travel at the speed of light, and again, a million times faster than a common bullet a common.
If we took that bullet and this set of photons and <unk> in this bottle, how do those photons spread into this <unk>
What is the aspect of the light in the <unk>
Now, all this --  --  -- remember, all of this is effectively in less than a <unk> is what it takes to travel the light.
But this video is 10 billion times slower so that you can see the light movement.
Coca-Cola is not going to do Coca-Cola --  <unk> a lot of things in this <unk> <unk> this information to show what's going on.
The pulse, our <unk> walks into the bottle with a little bit of photons <unk> it starts to <unk> and that inside, it starts to <unk>
Part of the light is <unk> goes to the table, and we started to see these <unk>
Many of the photons came to the cap and then they explode in various directions.
As you can see, there's an air bubble that bounces inside the inside.
At that time, the waves travel through the table, and because of the insights on the top of the top you see in the bottom of the bottle, after several boxes, that the insights are <unk>
Now, if we take a common <unk> and we make it go down the same distance and we see it in slow camera, about 10 billion times, how much people think it would take us to sit down to see that movie?
A day? A week? Actually, a whole year.
It would be a very boring film -- from a slow bullet movement.
And what about using nature <unk>
You can see the waves that were coming from the table, the tomato table, and the wall of the bottom.
It's like throwing a stone on a pond.
It is the way nature paints a picture, I was thinking, a <unk> at the time, but of course, our eyes see a full composition of it.
But if you look at one more time, you realize that, as the light gets <unk> it's still bright. It keeps <unk>
Why? Because the tomato is <unk> and the light bounces into its interior and it goes back from several <unk> of a second.
In the future, when this <unk> is in your mobile phone, they're going to be able to go to the supermarket and check if the fruit is grown without having to <unk>
So why do we create this camera in India?
As the photographers, you know, if we take a picture of the exhibition, it comes very little off.
But we're going to go to a billion times faster than a short, so I barely get into some light.
So we sent that <unk> that set of photons, millions of times, and we recorded over and over again with a very <unk> <unk> we took those <unk> from data and <unk> <unk> to create those <unk> that I showed you.
We can take all of those data in raw data, and we can make it interesting.
Superman can fly.
Other heroes can become invisible,
And if a new power of a future <unk> would allow you to see after the <unk>
The idea is that we could throw some light on the door. You get to the room, one part is going to reflect on the door, and from there to the camera.
And where we could extract those multiple light bulbs.
It's not science fiction. We have built it.
On the left, it's our <unk>
Behind the wall is a <unk> and <unk> the light on the door.
After the publication of our article in Nature <unk>
And a small fraction of the photons will go back to the camera, but interestingly, at slightly different times.
And as we have a camera that works so fast, our <unk> has unique capacities.
It has very good time resolution and you can look at the world at the speed of light.
So we know the distances up to the door and also the hidden objects -- but we don't know what point it is going to be a distance.
When I projecting a laser, you can record a photo in common: which, you see on the screen, it doesn't really make any sense.
But we will take a lot of images like this, dozens of images, the <unk> and we're going to try to look at the multiple light bulbs.
Can we see it <unk>
This is our reconstruction here.
We have things to explore before we get this from the lab, but in the future, we could create cars that are <unk> interacting with what's going to turn around the curve.
Or we could find survivors in dangerous conditions, looking at light reflected through open windows.
Or we could build <unk> <unk> able to see the interior of the body through <unk> and the same for <unk>
But of course, because of the fabric and blood this is quite hard, so this is actually a request for scientists to start thinking about the <unk> as a new form of visualization to solve the problems of health care in the next generation.
So as <unk> <unk> himself a scientist, became the science of art, an art of photographs <unk>
I realized that all of the data <unk> we collected every time not only for scientific visualization, but we can be able to figure that out.
We create a new form of computer photography with slow and <unk>
And look at those waves -- remember, time between each one of those waves is just a few <unk> of a second.
But here is something fun here.
If you look at waves under the <unk> you're going away from us.
<unk> should move to us.
What happens here?
It turns out, as we are recording almost at the speed of light, we have strange effects -- Einstein would have weird effects.
The order of the events that happen in the world sometimes comes to the camera.
<unk> the corresponding price of space and time, we can correct this <unk>
It's time. Thank you.
Hello. This is my mobile phone.
A mobile phone can <unk> life, and it gives you free freedom.
With a mobile phone, a crime in humanity in Syria.
With a mobile phone you can tweet a <unk> in Egypt.
With a mobile phone you can put up a song, put it to <unk> and get famous.
All of this is possible with a cell phone.
I'm a <unk> of 1984 and alive in the city of <unk>
Let's go back to that moment, to this city.
Here you can see how hundreds of thousands of people are going to be looking for a change.
This is the fall of 1989. Imagine if all of these people gathering that they are looking for a change, they had a mobile phone in your pocket.
Who of <unk> have a mobile phone here?
<unk>
Raise your mobile phone.
<unk> A Android, a Blackberry, wow!
It's a lot of people today have a mobile.
But today I'm going to talk about me, my mobile phone, and how my life changed me.
I'm going to talk about this.
These are 35 <unk> of information.
gross.
Why is that information there?
Because in the summer of 2006, the Commission of the E.U. presented a <unk>
<unk> <unk> <unk>
This directive says that every European phone company, every single city provider has to store a wide range of information from users.
Who calls <unk> Who sends an email to <unk>
Who sends it a text to <unk>
And if we use the mobile phone, where we are.
This whole information is stored by at least six months, and to two years, in their phone company or their <unk>
And in all Europe, people stood up and said, "We don't want this."
They said they didn't want this <unk>
We want the <unk> in the digital age, and we don't want the phone to and the Internet providers, all this information about us.
There were lawyers, journalists, priests, priests, everybody said, "We don't want this."
And here you can see about 10,000 people who came out to the streets of Berlin and they said, <unk> not <unk>
And some of them even said this would be <unk> 2.0.
The <unk> was the secret police in East Asia.
And I also wondered if this really works.
Can you store all this information about us?
Every time I use the <unk>
So I asked my phone <unk> <unk> <unk> that in that time, it was the largest telephone company in Germany, which was for me, all the information they had about me.
I asked them once, and I went back to visit them, and I didn't get a concrete answer. It was all blah.
But then I said, "I want to have this information because you are <unk> my life.
So I decided to give you a <unk> demand because I wanted to have this information.
But <unk> <unk> said no, we're not going to give you this information.
At the end of the end, he agreed.
<unk> the demand and they would send me the information that I <unk>
Meanwhile, the Supreme Court failed the <unk> for the German law of the E.U.
So I got this ugly about brown with a CD inside.
And in the CD there were this.
Thirty hundred and five thousand <unk> 30 lines of information.
When I first saw it, and I said, well, it's a huge file, OK.
But after a time I realized that it's my life.
There are six months of my life in this archive.
It was a little bit <unk> what had to do with that?
Because you can see where I am, where I step night, what am I doing.
But then I said, "I want this information <unk>
I want to make it public.
Because I want to show people what <unk>
So, along with <unk> <unk> and Open <unk> City, we did this.
This is a six months of my life.
You can zoom in, and go back and go forward.
You can see every step I want to do.
And you can see what I'm going from <unk> on train to <unk> and how often I call the way.
All of this is possible with this information.
That gives a bit of fear.
But it's not just about me.
But of all of us.
First of all, there are things like, I call my wife and she's called, <unk> a couple of times.
And then they call me a few friends and they call each other.
And then you call the other, and the other to the other, and we end up with this great network of communication.
You can see how your people communicate with each other and what time they call each other, what time they will sleep.
You can see all this.
You can see the centers, the leaders of the group.
If you have access to this information, you can see what the society is.
If you have access to this information, you can control your society.
This is a model for countries like China and Iran.
This is a model to study the shape of your society, because you know who speaks to whom, who sends an email to who, all of this is possible if you have access to this information.
And this information is stored at least six months in Europe, and to two years.
As I said at the beginning, imagine if all these people in the streets of Berlin, in the fall of 1989, they had a mobile phone in the pocket.
And the <unk> had known who I was involved in this protest, and if the <unk> had known who the leaders, this would never happen.
The fall of the Berlin Wall might never happen.
And, as a result, neither of the <unk> of <unk>
Because state agencies and companies want to store so much information from us as possible inside and outside the web.
They want to have the ability to follow our lives and want to take them forever.
But the <unk> and living in the digital age, it's not a contradiction.
But today you have to fight for <unk>
You have to fight for that every day.
When you come home to <unk> your friends that privacy is a value of the 21st century and it's not just about fashion.
When you go home to go home to your representative -- because companies and state agencies can store some information, they don't have to do it.
And if you don't believe me, ask your phone company, what information store in you.
So in the future, every time you use your mobile phones to help you remember that they have to fight for the <unk> in the digital age.
Thank you.
Hello, TEDWomen, what happens?
It's not enough.
Hello, TEDWomen, what happens?
I call myself <unk> <unk> and I'm not <unk> but I know the doctor that brought me to the world.
<unk> my mom six times in six different directions, <unk> to the poor of me in the process.
As a result of a result, I have cerebral palsy, and that's why we <unk> all the time.
<unk>
It's <unk> I am like a mix of <unk>
And Muhammad <unk>
<unk> P. It's not genetics.
It's not <unk> it can't be <unk>
No one <unk> the uterus from my mother and not <unk> because my parents were cousins, although they are.
It's just about accidents, as the one that came up at birth.
Now, I'm going to tell you, I'm not a source of inspiration -- and I don't want any of us to present it.
It feels bad for me, because at some point in life, you wish to be disabled.
Let's go on a walk.
Christmas Christmas are at the shopping center, drive in circles in search of parking lot, and what do you see?
16 empty places for disabled.
And they think, "God, can I be at least a little bit <unk>
In addition, I tell you, I've got 99 problems, and the P. C. is just one of them.
There was a <unk> of <unk> I would win the gold medal.
I'm a <unk> Muslim woman, and I live in New Jersey.
If you don't feel better, you probably should do it.
I'm from Park <unk> in New Jersey.
I always loved that my neighborhood and my disease had the same initial ones.
I also love if I wanted to walk from my home to New York, I would.
A lot of people with cerebral <unk> but my parents don't think of the definitively,
The mantra of my father was, "You can <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
If my three twin sisters were <unk>
If my three sisters were going to public school, my parents went to the school system and <unk> that I was also out there, and if we didn't take all the ultimate note -- every single one of my mother.
My father taught me to walk at five years by putting my <unk> on her feet and just walking.
Another tactic that I used was to hang a dollar in front of me so that I was able to get it.
The <unk> that I carry on was very strong and ...
Yes. The first day in the kindergarten was walking as a <unk> champion who has received a lot of taps.
Growing up, there were only six Arabs in my city and were all of the family.
Now there are 20 Arabic and still be every of the family.  I think nobody realized we weren't <unk>
This was before 9/11 and the politicians would think appropriate to <unk> to <unk> as a campaign.
The people that I grew up had had no problems with my faith.
However, it seemed to be a lot of <unk> a lot of hunger for the <unk>
I would tell you that I had enough fat to live three months without eating a eating, so <unk> at dawn at sunset is very easy.
<unk> <unk> in <unk>
Yes, in <unk> It's crazy.  My parents couldn't afford the physical therapy, so I was sent to the dance school.
I learned to dance with <unk> or I can walk with <unk>
I'm from New Jersey, and we want to be <unk> so if my friends were using <unk> I too.
And when my friends were going to spend the summer vacation on the coast of <unk> I was not going.
I spent my summers in a war zone, because my parents were afraid that if we were not going to go to Palestine all the <unk> we were going to get them in <unk>
On the holiday of summer often my father was trying to <unk> so I was drinking milk from <unk> so I would drink <unk> warm on the back, I was stuck in the <unk> Sea and I remember the water <unk> my eyes and I was like, <unk> <unk>
But the <unk> cure was yoga.
I have to say it's very boring, but before making yoga it was a <unk> comedian that I couldn't stand up <unk> <unk>
And now I can focus on your head.
My parents would come up with this idea that I could do anything, that no dream was impossible, and my dream was to be at <unk> Hospital.
I went to college through positive discrimination and I got a grant to the University of the state of Arizona, because it was in all the <unk>
It was like the <unk> of the theater.
I was <unk>
I made all the tasks of the least smart, put the ultimate note in my classroom, and also in their classes.
Every time I made a scene from the glass zoo of my <unk>
But I never got a piece of paper.
Finally, in my last year, the <unk> decided to make a work called <unk> very slow in Jackson.
It's a piece of a girl with cerebral <unk>
I was a girl with cerebral <unk>
So I started screaming at the four <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
I have <unk> <unk>
At the end of the end, <unk>
Thank God <unk> at the end of the end I'm a <unk>
I didn't get the paper.  You gave it to <unk> Brown.
I went to <unk> running into the CEO of the theater, crying in historically, as if someone had killed my cat, ask him why and she told me that they could not do the risk scenes.
And I said, <unk> if I can't do the risk, you can't get the <unk>
It was a paper that was literally born and gave it to an actor without the cerebral <unk>
I was imitating my life.
Hollywood has a <unk> story of <unk> actors who have no disabled actors for <unk>
When I did, I went home, and my first tour <unk> was as an extra <unk>
My dream became reality.
And I knew it would be <unk> to <unk> <unk> friend in a <unk>
Instead, I stayed there like a <unk> I didn't see me more than the <unk> and it was obvious to me that directors of <unk> did not <unk> actors, and she was not white, with disability.
It just <unk> perfect people.
But there were exceptions to rule.
I grew up looking at <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and all of these women had one thing in common: they were <unk>
So I did <unk>
In my first tour, I took top of New York City to New Jersey, and I never forget the face of the first comedian that took when he fell into the realization that it was going to high speed on the New Jersey highway with a driver who had brain <unk>
I worked in clubs all the United States, and also in Arabic in North Africa, without <unk> and <unk>
Some people say I'm the first <unk> in the Arab world.
I never like to reclaim the first place, but I know you never heard that little vibrating rumor that women are not fun, and they find very fun.
In 2003, my brother of another mother and father, Dean <unk> and I launched the <unk> Festival of New York City -- now in her 10.
Our goal was to change the negative image of the <unk> in the media and to remind the principals directors that <unk> and Arabic is not <unk>
<unk> to Arabs was much easier to fight the challenge of the stigma of disability.
My great opportunity came in 2010.
I went as invited to the news program program by cable <unk>
I walked in as if I went to a graduate dance, I was invited to a study and they sat on a wheelchair.
And I looked at the director and I said, <unk> can give me another <unk>
She looked at me and said, <unk> four, three, <unk>
And we were in <unk>
So I broke down the waiting desk to not go from the screen on the screen during the <unk> and when I finished the interview, I was <unk>
I finally had my opportunity and <unk> I knew they wouldn't go to me.
But not only Mr. <unk> went back to <unk> but he was just like participant in the whole time and taped my chair.
Something fun I learned in direct with Keith <unk> was that people on the Internet are <unk>
The kids are said that kids are <unk> but they never get away from me and no older girl in any day.
Suddenly, my disability on the Internet became <unk>
<unk> clips on the line with comments like, "Why do you <unk>
"It is <unk>
And my favorite <unk> <unk> terrorist <unk>
What disease is that?
We should really pray for it.
A <unk> suggested even that I would add my disability to my <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
<unk> is as visual as race.
If someone in wheelchair can't get <unk> then you can't get somebody in the wheelchair.
<unk> are the <unk> Yes, <unk> man. Come on.
<unk> are the largest minority of the world, and the most <unk> in the entertainment world.
The doctors were saying that I don't know -- but I'm here in front of you.
However, there was going to be the media, but I don't think <unk>
I hope that together we can create more positive images of disability in media and everyday life.
Maybe if there were more positive images, that would be less hate on the Internet.
Or maybe no.
Maybe we still need a whole society to teach our children.
My <unk> journey has taken me to very spectacular places.
I arrived at <unk> by the red carpet <unk> by the <unk> of Susan <unk> Susan <unk> and the famous <unk> <unk>
I got to act on a film with Adam <unk> and working with my <unk> the amazing Dave <unk>
<unk> the world <unk> <unk> have become <unk>
I was <unk> in representation of the great state of New Jersey in the <unk> of 2008.
And I founded <unk> a charity to give kids Syrian refugee children, a little bit of what my parents will tell me.
It was the only time my father saw me acting in alive, and I spent this talk to his memory.
<unk> <unk> <unk>
I call myself <unk> <unk> and if I can, you can too.
I'd like to tell you a story about a kid in a small town.
I don't know their name, but I know their story.
She lives in a small village to South <unk>
This people are near <unk>
<unk> drives the small people to poverty and on the edge of the <unk>
Without anything for him there, it goes to the big city, in this case, <unk> the capital of Somalia.
When you get there, there is no opportunities, there are no work, no <unk>
He just lived in a tent in the city outside of <unk>
After maybe a year <unk> nothing.
One day he was telling you a guy who offers him to take him back to dinner, then <unk>
He meets a dynamic group of people, which gives you a break.
She gets a little bit of money to buy new clothes, money to send home your family.
They show a young guy.
They finally went home.
It starts a new life.
It has a life goal.
A beautiful day in <unk> under a blue sky <unk> a bomb.
That little boy in that little town with dreams of the great city was the <unk> terrorist <unk> and that dynamic group of people were to <unk> a terrorist organization connected to al Qaeda.
So how the story of a little boy in a small town trying to fulfill their dreams in the city ends with him <unk>
He was waiting.
I was waiting for an opportunity, waiting to start his future, waiting for a perspective, and this was the first thing that arrived.
This was the first thing that he pulled out of what we call "the period of <unk>
And his story is repeating in urban centers around the world.
It's the story of the <unk> young urban <unk> <unk> riots in <unk> <unk> riots in London, who search for something beyond <unk> of <unk>
For the young people, the promise of the city, the great dream of the city is the opportunity of the opportunity, of jobs, but young people don't participate in the prosperity of their cities.
It's often youth that suffers from the highest rates of unemployment.
By 2030, three of five people living in cities will be under 18 years.
If we don't include the young people in the growth of our cities, if they don't care about opportunities, the story of the <unk> <unk> the door of access to terrorism, to violence, to be the story of cities.
And in my hometown of birth, <unk> 70 percent of the young people are <unk>
70 percent don't work, it's not going to school.
They do nothing pretty much anything.
I went back to <unk> last month, and I went to visit the <unk> Hospital.
I remember being in front of that hospital <unk> thinking, and if I never had gone?
And if I had been forced to be in that same <unk> <unk>
I would have become <unk>
I'm not really sure the answer.
The reason I was in <unk> that month was actually to support a juvenile leaders in a business peak.
<unk> about 90 juvenile leaders.
We sat down and we had a rain rain of ideas to the big challenges that the city faces.
One of the young people in the room was <unk>
He was at the University of <unk> <unk>
There was no work, no opportunity.
I remember when he told me, because I was a college college college student, was the perfect white white for Al <unk> and other organizations to be <unk>
They were looking for people like him.
But this story takes a different path.
In <unk> the biggest obstacle to get from point A to B is the streets.
<unk> years of civil war, have completely completely <unk> and a motorcycle can be the easiest way to <unk>
<unk> saw an opportunity and <unk>
He started a company of <unk>
He started <unk> <unk> to local residents who normally couldn't afford it.
I bought 10 <unk> with the help of his family and friends, and his dream is at some point to expand hundreds of <unk> over the next three years.
Why is this story?
What does this story different?
I think their ability to identify and leverage a new opportunity.
It's the corporate spirit -- and I think the spirit spirit can be the most powerful tool against <unk> of <unk>
They encourage young people to be the creators of the economic opportunities that are looking so fast.
And you can train the young people to be entrepreneurs.
I want to talk to you about a young man who was attending one of my meetings, Mohamed <unk> a <unk>
I was <unk> to train some of the young people at the height of the corporate initiative and how to be innovative and how to create a culture of business initiative to be <unk>
In fact, it's the first <unk> that <unk> has seen over 22 years, and until recently, until Mohamed came, if you wanted flowers for your <unk> <unk> we were running from plastic from the abroad.
If you beat somebody, "When was the last time you saw flowers.
For those of you who grew up during the civil war, the answer becomes, <unk>
So, Mohamed saw an opportunity.
He started a company of <unk> and design design.
I created a farm in the outskirts of <unk> and he started to grow <unk> and <unk> who said, they could survive the hard weather of <unk>
And it started the delivery of flowers for weddings by creating gardens in the houses, and the city companies and now is working on the creation of the first public park in <unk> in 22 years.
There is no public parks in <unk>
It wants to create a space where the families, young people, can go together, and as he says, smell the pink <unk>
By the way, he doesn't grow pink because they use a lot of water.
So the first step is to inspire young people, and in that room, the presence of Mohamed had a really profound impact on young people.
They had never thought about starting a business.
They had thought about working for an NGO, working for the government, but their story, but their story, it really had a strong impact on them.
He forced them to look at their city as a place of opportunity.
They encouraged them to believe that they could be entrepreneurs, that could be <unk> of change.
For the end of the day, they had innovative solutions for some of the biggest challenges facing the city.
<unk> business solutions for local problems.
So, I inspire young people to create a culture of corporate spirit -- it's really a great step, but young people need capital to make their ideas happen.
They need expertise and orientation to <unk> in development and put in their business.
<unk> young people with the resources that they need, and they need the support that they need to move from understanding the creation, and create <unk> for urban growth.
For me, the entrepreneurial spirit is something else that will start a business.
It's creating a social impact.
Mohamed is not just selling flowers.
I think it's selling hope.
Their Park Park so is how it calls it when it's created, transforming the way people see their city.
<unk> hired kids from the street to help rent and maintain the <unk> for him.
They gave them the opportunity to escape the <unk> of the <unk> of <unk>
These young entrepreneurs are having a tremendous impact on their cities.
So my suggestion is to become the young people in entrepreneurs, <unk> and eat their frugal innovation, and they will have more stories about flowers and Parks of Peace <unk> and <unk> of <unk>
Thank you.
I was about 10 years old, and I went to <unk> with my dad in the mountains in the mountains of the New York City.
It was a beautiful day.
The forest <unk>
The sun would make the leaves <unk> like a <unk> and it won't be on the way that we could almost pretend we were the first human beings to step on that land.
We got to our camp.
It was a shed in a <unk> with view to a beautiful <unk> lake when I discovered something horrible.
Behind the shed had a <unk> of about four square feet with apple hearts -- <unk> <unk> <unk> and old <unk>
And I was <unk> I was very angry and incredibly <unk>
The <unk> who were too lazy like to get what they thought was going to clean up their <unk>
That question followed me, and it was <unk> a little bit.
Who clean our <unk>
No matter how to <unk> or where they <unk> the <unk> who cleans our trash in <unk>
Who clean our trash in Rio or in Paris or <unk>
Here in New York City, the Department of <unk> clean our trash is about 11,000 tons of waste and two tons of products that were taken every day.
I wanted to know these as individuals.
I wanted to understand who does that work.
What does it feel to use the uniform and bring that <unk>
So I started a research project with them.
I traveled in the trucks and I walked out of his pathways, and I interviewed people in office and facilities in the entire city, and I learned a lot, but it was still a <unk>
I need to get more into more.
So I started working as a trash <unk>
Now I didn't just ride in the trucks. I <unk>
And <unk> and mechanical and <unk> the snow.
It was a remarkable privilege and an amazing learning.
Everyone wonders about smell.
It's there, but it's not as prevalent as you believe, and in the days in which it's very strong -- it will be <unk>
It costs a lot to get used to weight.
I met people who had worked on it for several years, and their bodies were still <unk> the weight of getting over their body tons of garbage all the weeks.
It's also the danger.
According to the Bureau of <unk> <unk> the waste collection is one of the ten most dangerous <unk> in the country, and I learned the reason.
You're coming out and moving into traffic all day and pass through them around you.
They just want to <unk> so in general the driver is not paying attention.
That's very bad for <unk>
And the trash itself is full of dangers that often fall out of the truck and cause terrible damage.
I also learned about the <unk> of garbage.
When you get out of the <unk> and you see a city from the back of the truck, you get to understand that garbage is like a force of nature itself.
Never stop coming.
It's also like a way of breathing or circulation.
It always needs to be movement.
And it's also the stigma.
It seems to me that stigma is especially ironic because I believe that the <unk> of waste are the most important workforce in the streets of the city, for three reasons.
They're the first license of public health.
If you don't get rid of the waste in the efficient and effective way of every day, this starts <unk> of their <unk> and their dangers inherent lives in very real ways.
What we had controlled for decades and centuries come back and start to <unk>
The economy needs them.
If we can't get rid of the old -- we don't have space for what the economy of the economy start to fail when it's in danger <unk>
I'm not advocating for capitalism, I just point out the relationship.
And then there's what I call our average average daily basis.
So what I mean is simply at the speed of the used that used to move into <unk>
We usually don't have to be able to do it, and we were able to get away with our coffee cup -- our coffee bag of the <unk> our water bottle.
We use, the <unk> we forgot about them, because we know that there is a job force on the other side that it will take away from it.
So today, I want to suggest to you a couple of ways of thinking about the collection of waste that might help reduce stigma and <unk> in that conversation about how to design a sustainable sustainable city.
Her work, I think, is almost <unk>
Are you in the street every day, <unk>
They use a uniform in many cities.
Do you know when <unk>
And their work allows us to do our own.
They're almost a form of relief.
The flow that keep us safe from ourselves, our own <unk> our <unk> and that flow is always due to stay in a way or another.
One day after September 11, 2001, I heard the <unk> of a waste collection truck on the street, grabbed my son a little bit and went down the stairs and I went down the stairs and there was a man doing his journey of recycled paper as I did all the <unk>
And I tried to thank you for doing his work that particular day, but I started to cry.
And he looked at me and just <unk> and said, "Let's be fine.
We're going to be right."
Soon after that, I started to investigate waste collection and I went back to that man.
It's called <unk> we work together a lot of times and we made good friends.
I want to believe that I was right.
We're going to be fine.
But in our efforts for <unk> the way we exist on this planet as a species we need to include and have to account all the costs, even the very real human cost of labor labor.
The city waste that we think when we talk about trash, they represent three percent of the whole nation of the nation.
It's a remarkable statistics.
So in the flow of their days and their lives, the next one you see someone whose work is cleaning up the garbage of you, <unk> a moment to <unk>
<unk> a moment to tell you thank you.
My work focuses on the connection of thinking about our communal life forming part of the environment where architecture is naturally from the conditions and local traditions.
Today I brought two recent projects like this.
Both projects are located in the emerging countries, one in Ethiopia and the other in Tunisia.
And they share the fact that the different analysis from different perspectives become an essential part of the final part of architecture.
The first example started with an invitation to design a shopping center in a number of floors in the capital of Ethiopia, Addis
This is the kind of building that showed us as an example, to my team and me, what we had to design.
At first, the first thing I thought was, "I want to go out <unk>
After seeing some of these buildings there are many in the city we realized that there are three important aspects to <unk>
In principle, these buildings are almost empty because they have very large stores where people can't afford to buy things.
Second, you need to employ a lot of energy because the lining coating generates heat in the interior, so you need a lot of <unk>
In a city where this should not happen because this is a temperate climate that goes from 20 to 25 degrees for all the year.
And thirdly, its brain looks like nothing to do with Africa and Ethiopia.
It's a worth of being so rich in culture and traditions.
In our first visit to Ethiopia, I was really fascinated with the old market that is this structure in the open air where thousands of people, go and buy things every single day <unk>
There's also that idea of using public space to generate external activity.
So I thought, that's what I really wanted to design, not a shopping center.
But the question was how to build a modern building of various stories, applying these principles.
The next challenge was presented to where the site is located in a lot of a lot of the city growth in the city, where a lot of the buildings that we now see in the image, didn't exist yet.
And it's also between two parallel streets that don't communicate in an extension of hundreds of meters.
So the first thing we did was to create a connection between these two streets, putting all the inputs out of the building.
And this spreads with a <unk> <unk> that creates a place to the free air in the building that was <unk> by its own way, the sun and the rain.
And around this space we've applied the idea of the market with small businesses, which changes in every floor because of the form of space.
I also thought, how to close the building?
I wanted to find a solution that <unk> the local climate conditions.
And I started thinking about a tissue similar to a concrete shell, with <unk> to allow the air input and also of the light, but in a <unk> way.
Then we were inspired by these beautiful buttons.
They have properties of fractal geometry and this helped me model the <unk>
We're building that with these little <unk> pieces that are the windows that leave the air and light in a way controlled inside the building.
This is <unk> with these little colored crystals that use the light inside of the building to illuminate the building at night.
And with these ideas it wasn't easy to convince developers because they thought, "That's not a shopping center -- it wasn't what we <unk>
But ultimately, we all realized that this idea of the market was much more profitable than the commercial center, because in the end of the world there was more local to sell.
And then the idea of the facade was far more economic -- not only because of the material compared to glass, but also because it wasn't necessary to have air conditioning.
So we got certain savings on the budget that we use to implement the project.
The first thing was to think about how to achieve the power of energy for the building in a city where electricity is almost every day.
So we got a big advantage by putting <unk> on the roof.
And then under those panels we think on the roof as a new public space with areas of meeting and bars that would create this oasis of urban oasis.
And these are <unk> on the roof, which collect water for the <unk>
It is expected for early next year, because we're going through the fifth floor of construction.
The second example is a master of 2,000 apartments and services in the city of Tunisia.
And to make a big project, the biggest project that I have designed, I needed not only to understand the city of Tunisia, but also their environment, their tradition and culture.
During that analysis, I put special attention on the <unk> a <unk> structure that was surrounded by a wall with twelve doors of access to almost straight.
When I went to place, the first design operation that we did was expand existing streets, creating 12 initial blocks similar to the size and characteristics that there are in Barcelona and other cities in Europe with these <unk>
In addition to that, we select some points in relation to the idea of <unk> doors with straight lines, and this changed the initial model.
And the last operation was to think about the cell, the little cell in the project, as the apartment, as an essential part of the master plan.
I thought, what would the best orientation be for an apartment in the climate <unk>
And it's <unk> because it creates a thermal difference between both sides of the house and therefore natural ventilation.
So <unk> a scheme that claims that most apartments are perfectly <unk> in that direction.
And this is the result that it's almost like a combination of the European block and the Arab city.
It has these blocks with <unk> and then in the lower plant we have all the connections for the <unk>
And it also responds to local norms that set up a greater density on higher levels and a lower density of the plant down.
And it also reinforces this idea of doors.
The roof, which is my favorite space of the project is almost like giving back to the community that occupied space <unk>
It's where all the neighbors can be able to climb and <unk> and do activities like running a race for two miles a morning, or jump from one building to the other.
These two examples, have a common approach in the design process.
And also, they're in the emerging countries, where you can see cities literally growing.
In these cities, the impact of architecture in the lives of people changes the communities and local economies at the same rate that grow buildings.
For this reason, I see even more important to look at architecture looking like simple solutions, but <unk> that improve the relationship between the community and the environment and that have a goal to connect the nature with people.
Thank you very much.
When I was eight years old, a new girl joined our class. It was as <unk> as you see all the new girls.
He had huge amounts of very bright hair and a little <unk> of <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> very good for <unk>
I ended up that year and I was full of jealousy, until I <unk> my sinister <unk>
One day I got a time after the return of school, I was a little evening, and I hid in the girls' bathroom.
When the coast was <unk> I walked into the classroom, I took the table of my teacher the prayer book.
And then I did.
I would take the ratings from my <unk> just a little bit, just some Like this.
All the way --  And I signed up with the book to <unk> but to see, some of my other fellow partners had very good notes as well.
So in a <unk> <unk> the notes around the world, without any imagination.
I put all of them out of <unk> and myself a row of that, just because I was there, because I <unk>
I'm still surprised by what I did.
I don't understand how the idea.
I don't understand why I felt well doing it.
I felt important.
I don't understand why I would never tell me.
It was all obvious to it.
I will never be surprised.
But most of all, I'm going to tell you the reason why I was bothered with this little little little bit of good for <unk>
I <unk> the jealousy.
They're so <unk> and so <unk>
We know that babies suffer from jealousy.
The primates. The birds are very <unk>
We know that <unk> are the number one cause of spouses in the U.S.
And yet, I've never seen a study that <unk> the loneliness, or the long duration or the sadness.
So you have to go to the fiction, because novels are like the lab in which we study <unk> in all of their possible forms.
In fact, I don't know if it's an exaggeration to say that if I didn't have happened, I would have no literature.
Well, I wouldn't have <unk> the <unk> there would be no <unk>
There was no king <unk> or <unk> and <unk>
I would have no <unk>
I took the <unk> lists of high school, because we would be losing "The <unk> and the <unk> would not have <unk> or <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk>
Without jealousy, There is no <unk> I know it's fashionable to say that <unk> has the answers for everything, and in terms of jealousy, almost all of them.
This year now is 100 years of their work <unk> "In the most <unk> study of the <unk> and the most <unk> study of the <unk> and the <unk> of mine, all that we could have.  And thinking about <unk> we have the details that are going on, right?
We think about a child trying to reconcile the dream.
We think about a <unk> <unk> in your <unk>
We forgot how hard that image.
We forgot about what it is.
I mean, it's about books that Virginia <unk> said they were so hard as <unk> <unk>
I don't know how to look at the cat, but we assume it's <unk>
Let's see why they go so well together, the novel and the <unk> and <unk> and <unk>
It's going to be very obvious as the jealousy, which is given to the person who is given to the person, their wish, their <unk> are a good narrative base.
I don't know. I think we get very close to the bone, when we think about what happens when we feel jealousy.
When we feel dumb, we tell ourselves a story.
A story about other people, and those stories make us feel terrible because they're designed for that, to make us feel wrong.
Being a storytellers and the audience, we know exactly what details to be done in order to cast the knife, right?
<unk> make all novelists <unk> and that's something that <unk> understand.
All that she does to give me pleasure could give me pleasure to another, maybe myself."
And it starts to say to himself that story, and since then, <unk> says that every single fresh charm that <unk> detects in its lover -- adds to its collection of instruments of torture in his private camera.
You have to admit that <unk> and <unk> were notoriously <unk>
You know, <unk> <unk> would have to leave the country, if they wanted to break with it.
But you don't have to be so <unk> to recognize that it's hard work. Right?
<unk> are <unk>
Is it an <unk> <unk>
And how are the <unk>
<unk> <unk> of information.
<unk> use the details.
The <unk> like the great pile of bright hair, and the cute little <unk> of <unk>
The <unk> got rid of the photos.
That's why Instagram is so successful -- <unk> links well the <unk> language with the jealousy.
When <unk> is in his agony of jealousy, suddenly listening behind the doors and <unk> the <unk> of their lover -- then defends those behaviors.
He says, "Look, I know you think this is <unk> but it's not different to the interpretation of an old text or looking at a <unk>
He says, "These are <unk> scientific research with real value <unk>
<unk> is trying to prove that the <unk> look <unk> and they do seem to be <unk> but in their <unk> they are searching for knowledge, a really painful truth -- in fact, to what <unk> <unk> the most painful -- the better truth -- the better.
The pain, the <unk> the <unk> These were the pathways to the wisdom of <unk>
He says, "A woman who needs to do, which makes us suffer, to lead to us a lot of very deep feelings and vital than a wise man who can tell us about it.
It's telling us that we're going to look for women <unk>
No. I think it's trying to say that the <unk> reveal ourselves.
And there's some other excitement that makes us <unk> in this particular way.
There is some other excitement to us -- our <unk> our horrible ambition and our <unk>
Some other excitement that teaches us to look at <unk> intensity <unk>
Freud would write about this later.
One day, Freud visited for a very <unk> young man who was consuming with the idea that his wife was <unk>
And Freud says there was something strange in that man, who didn't be <unk> in what his wife did.
Well, she was <unk> everybody knew it.
The poor creature was under suspicion without any cause.
But he was looking for things that he was doing his wife, without realizing it, <unk> behaviors.
<unk> <unk> or clearly accidentally <unk> with a man?
Freud say the man was becoming the <unk> of the unconscious of your wife.
<unk> are very good at this.
<unk> describe very well how <unk> do us look at intensity but no precision.
In fact, the more intensely <unk> we are, more we can become <unk>
And for this reason, I think, <unk> lead us to a violent or illegal.
<unk> drive us to behave in totally <unk> ways.
Now I'm thinking about me at the age of eight years, but I'm also thinking about this story that I heard in the news.
A woman of Michigan from 52 years of age was captured by having created a false account on Facebook from the one that would send the messages <unk> horrible to itself, for a year.
For one year, a year.
She was trying to join the new girlfriend of his former old name, I have to confess that when or this, I reacted with <unk>
Because, let's be realistic.
How large, if you think about creativity. Right?
It's like <unk>
Like a novel from Patricia <unk>
<unk> is one of my favorites.
She's a very strange and brilliant character of American literature.
It's the author of <unk> in a <unk> and "The <unk> Mr. <unk> books that are trying to address our minds, and once we are in the sphere, in the realm of jealousy, the membrane that separates what it might be, can be <unk> in a second.
Take Tom <unk> his most famous character.
Tom <unk> goes from <unk> or want what you have to get to the <unk> of your being and <unk> of what ever <unk> and it's under the floor -- <unk> your name, takes your <unk> cow bank accounts.
It's a way.
But what do we do? We can't take the route of Tom <unk>
I can't give you all over the world, as much as I want to want to.
It's a pity, because we live in a time of envy.
We live at jealousy.
I mean, we're good citizens of social media, where the currency is <unk> right?
<unk> show us the <unk> I'm not sure.
So we're going to do what the characters are always when they're not safe when they are to a mystery.
Let's go to <unk> Street and ask for <unk> <unk>
When people think about <unk> they think about <unk> <unk> in Professor <unk> that criminal genius is.
But I've always got <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> who needs <unk> <unk> needs the <unk> genius, but it bothers him.
Oh, it sounds so <unk>
<unk> it needs their help, but they <unk> it with <unk> in each of the puzzles.
But as they work together, something starts to change, and eventually in "The <unk> of the Six <unk> once <unk> <unk> on all with his solution, <unk> <unk> and says, "We're not <unk> Mr. <unk>
We're proud of <unk>
And he tells him that there's no person in <unk> <unk> who doesn't want to be <unk> your hand.
It's one of the times that we see <unk> <unk> in history. I think this is very emotional -- that scene is also mysterious, right?
It seems to treat <unk> as a problem of geometry, without emotion.
You know, in a minute <unk> is the opposite side of <unk>
The next minute you're on the same side.
Suddenly, <unk> allows it to be <unk> that idea of being <unk>
It could still be that easy?
What if <unk> are really a matter of geometry, just a question of where we allow us to be relative to other?
Well, maybe we don't have to get rid of the excellence of the other.
We can engage with it.
But I like <unk>
So while we hope that this happens, we will remember that we have the fiction for <unk>
It's just fiction fiction -- the jealousy.
<unk> alone invites them to the table.
And look at what the sweet <unk> <unk> the terrifying <unk> Tom <unk> the mad, <unk> <unk> <unk>
We're in great company.
Thank you.
We used to solve big problems.
On July 21 in 1969, Buzz Aldrin jumped out of the <unk> <unk> of Apollo 11 and landed on the Sargasso Sea.
Armstrong and <unk> were themselves, but his presence on the surface gray of the <unk> was the culmination of a collective collective process.
The Apollo program was the largest decline in peace in American history.
To get to the moon, NASA spent about 180 billion dollars today, or four percent of the federal budget.
Apollo did work about 400,000 people and asked about 20,000 people, universities and universities and government agencies.
They were killed, including the crew of Apollo 1.
But before the Apollo program program 24 men went to the moon.
<unk> walked over his surface, which I assumed after the death of Armstrong did last year, is now the most <unk>
So why do we <unk>
They didn't get a lot of <unk> <unk> pounds of old rocks, and something that 24 <unk> later, a new sense of <unk> and the fragility of our ordinary home.
Why <unk> The cynical answer is that they were because President Kennedy wanted to show the <unk> that this nation had a better rockets.
But the words of Kennedy at the University of Rice University in <unk> give us a better idea.
John F. <unk> Some people ask, why is <unk>
Why do it turn it into our goal?
And you might ask, why is it going to scale the most <unk>
35 years ago, why are you flying over the <unk>
Why is he playing Rice <unk>
We chose to go to the moon.
We chose to go to the moon.
We choose to go to the moon in this decade, and doing other things, not because they're simple, but because they're hard.
Jason <unk> For the <unk> the <unk> was not just a victory of the west of the West on the Cold War.
At the time, the stronger emotion was the <unk> to the importance of the powers of technology.
They were because it was great to be able to do it.
The landing on the moon happened in a context of a long <unk> <unk>
The first half of the 20th century produced the assembly line and the plane, penicillin and the vaccine for tuberculosis.
In the middle of the century, the <unk> <unk> and removed the smallpox.
Technology seemed to own what Alvin <unk> in 1970 called <unk> <unk>
For most of the history of humanity, we couldn't go faster than a horse or a ship with candle -- but in 1969, the crew of Apollo 10 flew at 40,000 miles an hour.
Since 1970, no human being turned to the moon.
No one has traveled faster than the crew of Apollo 10, and the <unk> optimism about the power of technology has been <unk> to see that problems that we imagine that technology would solve as going to Mars, create a clean energy, cure cancer, or to feed the world population seem to be <unk>
I remember watching the <unk> <unk>
I was five years old, and my mother told me that he didn't go to the <unk> <unk> <unk> of the rocket get sick.
I knew so much that this would be the ultimate <unk> mission, but I was completely sure that I would get to see the colonies on Mars.
So this is what it occurred to our ability to solve problems with <unk> has become a common place.
We heard it all the time.
We've heard this for the last two days here, at TED.
It seems like if the technologists would have met us, and they had <unk> with trivial, things like <unk> or social applications and social media, or algorithms that speed <unk>
There's nothing wrong with most of these things.
They have expanded and enriched our lives.
But we don't mean the big problems of humanity.
What happened?
There's a <unk> explanation in Silicon Valley, that <unk> who have created less ambitious companies than <unk> in the years of the years that was <unk> Intel and Microsoft, and <unk>
Silicon Valley says that markets are the <unk> in concrete, the incentives that venture capitalists offer to entrepreneurs.
Silicon Valley says that the risk of risk caused us to <unk> the creation of ideas -- to the funding of <unk> problems or even false problems.
But I don't think this explanation is good enough.
<unk> mostly what's wrong with <unk> Valley.
Even when venture capitalists were at their high point without worrying about the risk, they preferred small investments, a minute that they could go out in 10 years.
<unk> have always had trouble to invest in technologies like energy, which need a huge capital and development of development is also not invested in the development of technologies dedicated to solve big problems because they don't have a real commercial value.
No, the reasons why we can't solve big problems are more complicated and profound.
Sometimes, we choose not to solve the big problems.
Could we go to Mars if you <unk>
NASA has even designed a plan.
But go to Mars would require a political decision that was popular, and that will never happen.
We're not going to go to Mars because everyone thinks there are more important things to do on Earth.
Sometimes, we cannot solve the big problems because political systems fail.
Today, less than two percent of the world's energy consumption comes from sources of renewables like solar and wind and <unk> less than two percent, and the reason is completely cheap.
Nuclear and natural gas is cheaper than solar and wind, and the oil is cheaper than <unk>
We want sources of alternative energy that can compete in the price.
Now, technologists, and the economists and economists agree about what policies and international treaties -- the development of energy <unk> <unk> a significant increase in research and development, and some kind of control of the price of coal.
But there is no hope in the current political climate that we will see an energy policy in America or international treaties that reflect that consensus.
Sometimes the big problems that they seemed technological, they are not going to be.
We know for the time that famines are a result of failure in the food <unk>
But 30 years of research have taught us that famines are political crisis that affect <unk> the distribution of food.
The technology can improve things like harvest or the systems for the storage and <unk> of food, but there will be massive famines while there were bad governments.
Finally, big problems are sometimes <unk> a solution because we don't understand the problem.
The president is to declared the war to cancer in 1971, but we soon found that there are a lot of cancer types, some terribly resistant to the treatment, and only in the last 10 years they seem to have been found effective and viable.
The hard problems are hard.
It's not true that we couldn't solve the problems with technology.
We can and we need -- but these four elements have to be <unk> the political leaders and the population must want to solve the problem, the institutions must support the <unk> it must be really about a <unk> problem, and we need to understand it.
The <unk> mission that has become something like a metaphor for the ability of technology to solve great problems, it does with those bill.
But it's a <unk> model in the future.
We're not in <unk>
There's no <unk> competition as in the Cold War, there is no politician like John Kennedy that <unk> how hard and dangerous, and there's no popular mythology of science fiction as the solar system <unk>
In general, going to the moon it turned out to be easy.
I was just three days.
And I really, didn't even have a problem.
We're alone in our present, and the solutions of the future will be more difficult to get.
God knows that we don't have the challenges.
Thank you very much.
Well, I'm going to talk about trust, and I'm going to begin with <unk> the ideas that are about trust.
They're so common that they've become <unk> of our society.
I think it's three.
The first one is a <unk> there's been a great decline of trust, it's a very general thought.
The second is a goal: we should have more trust.
And the third is a <unk> we should recover the trust.
I think <unk> the goal and the task have been <unk>
What I'm going to try and tell you today is a different story about a <unk> a goal and a task, which I think gives you a more clear idea about the subject.
First of all, why people think that trust has <unk>
And if I think about the basis of my own <unk> I don't know the answer.
I bow to think that it may have fallen down in some activities or institutions and that could have increased others.
I don't have sure.
But I can turn to opinion polls and opinion polls are supposedly the source of belief that trust has <unk>
When you look at opinion polls over time, there are no evidence of it.
I mean, the people who were <unk> 20 years ago, mostly journalists and politicians, still <unk> the same <unk>
And the people who were very reliable about 20 years ago are still quite <unk> the nurses.
The rest of us are in the middle, and by the way, the average citizen of the street is almost exactly halfway back.
But is this evidence for enough?
What the research polls are, of course, opinions.
What else can you get?
What you see is the <unk> attitudes that people play when they do certain questions.
<unk> in the <unk> <unk> in the <unk>
Now, if someone asked you to tell you, <unk> in the <unk>
<unk> in the <unk>
<unk> at <unk> teachers.
You probably want to ask yourself, "To do what?"
And that would be a very <unk> answer.
And you could say, when you've answered your question, "Well, I trust some, but other not."
What's very rational.
Ultimately, in real life, we tend to <unk> confidence.
We don't assume that the level of trust we're going to feel for a given kind of <unk> official or a person who is going to be uniform in all cases.
I could, for example, say I trust a certain teacher of elementary primary school I know to give the kind of reading, but no way to drive the school <unk>
After all, I could know that it wasn't a good <unk>
I could trust my friend more <unk> to keep a conversation, but no, maybe to keep a secret.
Simple.
And if we've got those evidence in our everyday lives in the way that trust is <unk> why we leave all of that knowledge when we think about trust in a more <unk>
I believe that polls are very bad tools to measure the true level of real trust, because they try to get the good inherent trial to the fact of trusting something or somebody.
Second, what about the goal?
The goal is to have more trust.
Frankly, I think it's a stupid.
This is not that the goal that I would get.
I would be able to have more confidence in what it is <unk> but not what it isn't.
In short, I'm <unk> you don't trust what it's not reliable.
And I think that those people who are <unk> their savings with the very <unk> called Mr. <unk> who then disappeared with them, I think of them, and I think, well, yeah, they were too <unk>
Having more confidence is not a smart goal in this life.
<unk> deposited or <unk> with intelligence, that's the right target.
Once you say, yeah, yeah, this means that what matters in the first place is not the trust, but trustworthiness.
What is about doing a judgment on how reliable people are in certain ways.
And I think to be able to make a trial, we're forced to focus on three things.
They're <unk> They're <unk> They're <unk>
And if we found one person is <unk> in the raw commodities and it's responsible and honest, then we'll have a very good reason for trust on it, because it's going to be worthy of trust.
But if, on the contrary, they're not responsible for you couldn't trust them.
I have friends who are <unk> and honest, but not <unk> in them to get a letter to the mail because they're <unk>
I have friends who are very sure that they can do certain things, but I see that I see your own <unk>
And I'm glad to say that I think I don't have a lot of friends who are <unk> and responsible but extremely <unk>
If that's like this, I don't have any <unk>
But that's what we're going to do is that we are looking at before we trust.
The trust is the answer.
<unk> is what we have to <unk>
And of course, it's hard.
In the last few decades, we have tried to build systems of accountability for all sorts of institutions, professionals, officials and others, and so that they made us easier to judge their trustworthiness.
A lot of those systems have had the opposite effect.
They don't work like <unk>
I remember one time I was talking to a <unk> and he said, "Well, you'll see the problem is that it takes more time to make <unk> that will go to <unk>
And we found the same problem in all of our public life, and we hope that the accountability of accountability which is destined to ensure the <unk> and the <unk> evidence is actually doing the opposite.
What they do is they <unk> the work of the people who have to do hard tasks, like the <unk> <unk> that <unk> <unk> as we say.
You have all of you all of you have similar examples.
<unk> all that, by the target.
I think that the goal should be more <unk> and that things would be different if you try to be worthy of trust and encourage people to be reliable and if we want to determine whether other people or politicians are worthy of trust.
It's not easy. It's the judgment, and simple actions -- what you don't really do properly.
Third, the task.
And we would get to the task to rebuild the trust, puts things backwards.
It suggests that you and I should rebuild the trust.
Well, we can do it with ourselves.
We can rebuild a little bit of trustworthiness.
We can do it if they're two people, together, trying to improve trust.
But the trust, ultimately, it's defining because they give us other people.
You can't reconstruct what other people have given you.
You have to give them the foundations enough so that you can trust you.
You have to be worthy of trust.
And that, of course, is because you can't <unk> all of the people, all the time.
But you also have to be able to provide <unk> evidence that you're worthy of trust.
How do you do that?
That is done every day, everywhere, making the common people, the <unk> the institutions, very effectively.
I'll give you a simple commercial example.
The store where I buy my socks says I can <unk> without giving explanations <unk>
I wear them and get it back for me and get the money, or they change the color of the color I want.
That's great. I trust them because they themselves became vulnerable to me.
I think there's a big lesson in that.
If you become vulnerable to the other part, that's a very good proof that you're worthy of trust and you have confidence in what you're saying.
So, at the end, I think that what we're pointing is not something very difficult to <unk>
What people trust is in relationships, and in that framework, you can determine when and how the other person is worthy of trust.
Thank you.
From the beginning of computers we have been <unk> by reducing the separation between us and the digital information, the separation between our material and the world of the screen in which the imagination can be <unk>
This separation has been more and more and more and more and more, to a point that today is less than one millimeter, the thickness of a <unk> screen and the power of computing has become accessible to everyone.
But I ask myself, and if I didn't have <unk>
So I started to imagine how to <unk>
So first I created this tool that goes on into the digital space, so that when the strong <unk> against the screen the screen the physical body to the pixels.
Designers can <unk> their ideas directly in 3D, and surgeons can practice virtual organs under the screen.
So with this tool break down.
But the two hands remain still out of the screen.
How do you get inside and interact with digital information using all the dexterity of your hands?
In the Computer Science division of Microsoft, with my mentor <unk> <unk> <unk> the computer and transformed a little space on the keyboard in a digital area of work.
<unk> a transparent bombsight with chambers of depth to detect your fingers and the face, you can now lift the hands of the keyboard, get inside of the 3D space, and grab pixels directly with your hands.
As windows and files have a location in the real space, <unk> it's as easy as a book from a <unk>
You can flip through the book and highlight the lines or the words with the virtual touch sensor that there is below every floating screen.
Architects can stretch or rotate their models directly with hands.
In these examples, we <unk> in the digital world.
And if we invest the papers and we make digital information come into us?
<unk> many of us will be bought and always returned to the Internet.
Now that doesn't have to worry about.
What I have here is a virtual <unk> on the Internet.
This is the vision that you get from a device on the head or <unk> when the system understands the geometry of your body.
If we take this idea further, I thought, instead of just seeing pixels in space, how we can make it be physicists so that we can <unk> and <unk>
How would a future look like?
At the MIT Media Lab, with my tutor Hiroshi Ishii, and my collaborator <unk> Post, we created this single physical pixel room.
This imam <unk> behaves like a 3D cave in space, which means that the computer as the users can move the object anywhere inside this small three-dimensional space.
<unk> what we did was we <unk> the gravity and control the movement through a combination of levitation and <unk> <unk> mechanical and <unk>
And by programming the object, we put it out of the constraints of time and space, which means that human movements can <unk> and go back to reproduce and be always in the physical world.
They can teach physically <unk> and distance and the famous shot of Michael Jordan, you can reproduce as a physical reality, sometimes we want.
Students can use it as a tool to understand complicated concepts like the movement of planets, the physics, and unlike monitors or the textbooks -- this is a real and palpable experience that you can play and feel.
But what's more fascinating than changing the physics of the computer is to imagine how to program the world is going to change our everyday physical activities.
As you can see, digital information is not just going to show you something but begin to act directly about us as part of the physical world that surrounds us without that we have to <unk> our world.
So we started talking about a barrier, but if we took that barrier, the only limit that's left is our imagination.
Thank you.
I was <unk> to become <unk> for two years in <unk> China, in the <unk> years.
When I was in the first grade, the government wanted to join a school to athletes with all expenses paid.
But my tiger mother said, "No."
My parents wanted to become engineering, like them.
After surviving the Islamic Revolution, they believed firmly that there was only an accurate path to <unk> a safe and good job.
No matter whether I would like the work or not.
But my dream was to be a Chinese opera woman.
This was me, in my imaginary piano.
An opera singer has to start <unk> from very young to learn the <unk> so I tried everything I could to go to opera school.
And I was able to wrote to the director of the school and the death of a radio program.
But no adult would tell you the idea.
No adult took me seriously.
Just my friends, but they were children, without authority, like me.
So at the age of 15, I knew it was too much more for train.
My dream is never <unk>
<unk> that during the rest of my life a second class happiness was the only thing that I could aspire to.
And this was so unfair.
So I resolved to look for another <unk>
No one to me wanted to say, <unk>
They went to the books.
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> -- I came to America in 1995, and what were the first books I read here?
Those who were <unk> in China, of course.
"The Good <unk> is about life <unk>
And it's not a foreign <unk>
The Bible is interesting, but weird.
That's a subject for another day.
But the fifth commandment for me was a <unk> <unk> your father and your mother."
<unk> I said. "It's so different, and much better than <unk>
So it became my tool to go out of this <unk> <unk> and to reset the relationship with my parents.
I find this with a new culture that I also gave my reading out of reading <unk>
<unk> a lot of perspectives.
For example, at the beginning this map seemed to me about place because this is what the students in China learning it.
I'd never occurred to me that China didn't have to be in the center of the world.
A map involves the perspective of people.
The comparative reading is not new.
It's common practice in the academic world.
There is to research in research as a comparative religion and literature.
<unk> and <unk> offers the academics a deeper understanding of a subject.
And I thought if the comparative reading work worked for research, why not do it as well in life <unk>
So I started reading books.
They can be <unk> <unk> from Walter <unk> <unk> <unk> from David <unk> who were involved in a <unk> or friends with <unk> experiences.
For <unk> the <unk> are economic and spiritual <unk>
For Buddha, they're all <unk> lust, fear and <unk> <unk> Interesting.
If you know another language, it's also fun to read your favorite books in two languages.
<unk> <unk> Thomas <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> -- instead of lost in the translation, found that you can win a lot of it.
For example, it's through the translation that I realized is that <unk> Chinese means <unk> <unk> <unk>
And <unk> in Chinese, literally means <unk> <unk> <unk>
The books opened me a magic door to connect with people in the past and the present.
I know I'm not going to go back to feeling alone or powerless never.
Having a dream dream really is nothing compared to what many others have <unk>
I've come to believe that the realization is not the only purpose of a dream.
Its most important purpose is to connect with the place of dreams, where the passion comes from where happiness comes from.
A <unk> dream can do that for you.
And it's thanks to the books, which I'm here, happy, living again with purpose and clearly, most of the time.
So the books always <unk>
Thank you.
Thank you.  Thank you.
When I was in my <unk> I saw my first client <unk>
I was a Ph.D. student in clinical psychology at Berkeley.
She was a <unk> woman named <unk>
Alex came back to the first session using jeans and a <unk> stumbled onto my office and grabbed my shoes and told me she wanted to talk about their problems with men.
When I heard this, I felt so <unk>
My roommate had a <unk> as a <unk>
And I had a <unk> who wanted to talk about men.
I thought I could handle it.
But I didn't.
With the stories that Alex brought to the <unk> it made me easy to move my head while I would get the solution.
<unk> are the new <unk> he said, Alex, and so I saw her, she was right.
You start to work later on, she has children later on, and then the death goes next.
The <unk> and I had time <unk>
But shortly afterwards, my <unk> pushed me to Alex who would talk about his life <unk>
I was surprised.
I said, "Sure, it's coming out with guys under his category, <unk> with a <unk> head, but it's not like it was to marry it."
And then my <unk> said, "No, no, but maybe it's <unk> with the next.
In addition, the best time to work in Alex marriage is before they were <unk>
This is what psychologists call a <unk> moment.
It was when I realized that the <unk> are not the new <unk>
Yes, people feel their head after what they got out, but this didn't make the <unk> of Alex to be a pause in it.
This made the <unk> of Alex being the perfect moment and we were <unk>
And so I realized that this kind of benign recklessness was a real problem and had real consequences, not only to Alex and his <unk> life but for careers, families and future <unk>
There are 50 million <unk> in the United States, today.
This means 15 percent of the population, or 100 percent if you think that nobody gets to age without going through the <unk>
Raise your hand if you're in your <unk>
I want to see the <unk> here.
Oh, Yes! They're amazing.
If they work with <unk> they love a <unk> <unk> <unk> I want to see. It's fine. <unk> the <unk> really matter.
This is not just my opinion. These are the facts.
We know that 80 percent of the key moments in life will spend 35 years.
That means eight of every 10 decisions and experiences and transcendent moments that give her life to have happened to when they have 30 and <unk>
People in more 40, I don't trained <unk>
This audience is going to be okay, I think.
We know that the first 10 years of a race have an exponential impact on the amount of money that we have.
We know that more than half of Americans are married, or they're coming out with their future partner at 30 years.
We know that the brain ends up its second and last stage of growth in their <unk> and it gets <unk> for the <unk> which means that if there's something you want to change itself, now is the moment to change it.
We know that personality changes more times during their <unk> than at any other moment of life, and we know that female fertility comes to the top 28, and things become complicated to <unk>
<unk> are the moment to get rid of their body and their options.
When we think about the developing child, we all know that the first five years are critical for language and attachment into the brain.
It's a moment where your daily life and common has an impact on the person who is <unk>
But what we don't hear is that there's something called adult development and our <unk> are a critical moment in adult development.
But this is not what the <unk> are listening.
The newspapers talk about changes in the timeline.
Researchers call the <unk> a extended <unk>
<unk> told him <unk> names like <unk> and <unk>
It's true.
As a culture, we have considered a <unk> which is actually the decade that defines the <unk>
Leonard <unk> said that to achieve big things, you need a plan and not enough time.
It's not it?
What do you think happens when you give a <unk> in your head and say, "You get another 10 years to start your <unk>
Nothing happens.
They stole it to that person the sense of urgency and his ambition and it's absolutely nothing.
And then every single day, smart, interesting parents like you or your kids come up to my office and they say something like this: "I know my boyfriend, is not good for me, but this relationship is not really <unk> I'm just killing time."
Or they say, "Everybody says that while I start a career before the 30, everything will be right."
But then it starts sound like this: "My <unk> are <unk> and I still have nothing to show you.
I was better at the day that I graduated from <unk>
And then it starts sound like this: "My quotes during the <unk> were like the game of chairs.
They were all running and <unk> but then at some point in the 30, it turned out the music and everyone started to sit.
I didn't want to be the only one who would be left stop, so I sometimes think I married my husband because he was the nearest chair when I had <unk>
Where are the <unk> here?
Don't do that.
Well, that sounds a little bit extreme, but it's not <unk> the risks are very high.
When you leave a lot of things for <unk> there's a huge pressure to the 30 and so many of you start a career, pick a city, and pick a city, and have two or three children in a much more short period of time.
A lot of these things are not <unk> and there's research that starts to show you, which is much harder and stressful to do everything from once to <unk>
The middle age crisis, it's not about buying your red car cars.
It's about realizing you can't have the race you want now.
<unk> you may not have the son you want now, or you can't give him a brother to your son.
Many <unk> and <unk> you see themselves, and I sat in the room, and they talk about their <unk> "What was I doing? What was I thinking?"
I want to change what the <unk> are doing and thinking.
Here's a story of how it might be.
It's a story about a woman named <unk>
By the 25, Emma came to my office because it was, in his own words, having a identity crisis.
He said I'd like to work in art or in the entertainment, but I couldn't still decide, so I spent the last few years working as <unk>
As it was cheaper, he lived with a boyfriend, who showed more <unk> than ambition.
And despite living a lot of <unk> very difficult life had been even more difficult.
They were often often in our <unk> but then she was getting up to say, "You don't choose your family, but it can choose to your friends."
Well, one day Emma got his head on his legs and I cried during almost every hour.
I had just bought a new book <unk> and I had spent the whole morning <unk> with his many <unk> but then he was looking at the empty space that follows after the words of words -- please call <unk> <unk>
I was at the point of <unk> when he saw me, and he said, "Who is going to be for me if I have a <unk> accident.
Who is going to take care of me if it gives me <unk>
At that moment, it took me a lot of work to resist to resist and say, <unk>
What Emma needed was not a <unk> that really was <unk>
Emma needed a better life, and I knew this was their opportunity.
I had learned a lot since I worked with Alex as to just sit while the decade <unk> of Emma would go forward.
So for the next few weeks and months, I told Emma three things that all of men or woman, deserves to know.
First of all, I told Emma that it was going to be <unk> from that identity crisis and <unk> identity capital.
For identity, I mean to do something that add value to your person.
Doing something that is an investment in what you want to be next.
I didn't know the future of <unk> and nobody knows the future of work, but I know this: identity capital generates identity.
So now it's the moment for that work on the other side of the country, that <unk> of that company they want to try it.
I'm not <unk> <unk> exploration, and I'm <unk> the exploration that I shouldn't count, which, by the way, it's not exploration, right?
It's <unk>
I said to Emma who would explore jobs and to make it out.
Secondly, I told Emma that urban tribes are <unk>
The best friends are great to take you to the airport, but the <unk> you get together with friends with similar minds as well as well as you know who you know how to think, how you think, how talk and where they work.
That new piece of capital, that new person who comes out almost always comes from their nearest circle.
The new things come from what they call weak ties friends from their friends.
Yes, half of the people have a bad job or they don't have work.
But the other half not, and the weak links are the way we can engage this group.
Half of the work created never <unk> then to meet the chief of your neighbor is the way you get a job of a job.
It's not <unk> It's the science of how information happens.
For the last but not least, Emma believed that you don't pick her family, but I know their friends.
This was true when I was growing up, but as it was <unk> Emma would soon join his family when he has a partner and he exists his own family.
I told Emma that the time to choose his family had come.
Maybe you think that 30 is better age to sit my head than the 20 or even 25 and I agree with you.
But choosing the person who you live now, or you're going to tell you now when all of you on Facebook start to walk towards <unk> it's not progress.
The best time to work in your marriage is before you have, and that involves being so intentional in love as you're at work.
<unk> your family must be a conscious choice of who and what they want instead of just making it work or kill you who are going to go to you.
So what happened to <unk>
Well, we looked at that <unk> and she found a fellow from a prime woman who was working on an art museum in another state.
This weak link helped him get a job there.
That set of work gave a reason to leave the boyfriend who he alive.
Now, five years later, it's <unk> special events in museums.
This married a man who chose <unk>
<unk> his new career, he loves his new family, and I send to a letter that said, "Now the spaces of emergency contacts are not enough <unk>
The story of Emma can sound easy, but that's what I love about working with <unk>
It's very easy to help you.
The <unk> are as planes who come out of Los Angeles, who come up to some place in the West.
Just before the <unk> a slight match in its trajectory makes the difference between land in Alaska, or <unk>
In the same way, at 21 or 25 and even <unk> a good job, a good TED Talk can have huge effects over the next few years or even in the next generation.
This is my idea worth spreading all the <unk> you know.
It's as simple as what I learned to say to <unk>
This is what I now have the privilege of telling <unk> like Emma every day: <unk> are not the new <unk> <unk> their <unk> get their <unk> they get identity, and they get their weak ties.
Don't be defined by what they didn't know or what they didn't do.
They're deciding their life today.
Thank you.
When I was 27 years old, I left a very <unk> job in management <unk> for a job that was even more <unk> <unk>
I went to teach them mathematics to American <unk> in New York City.
And as any professor, I made tests and tests.
I give them assignments.
When I work the work back, I would give grades.
What struck me the attention was that I.Q. was not the only difference between my best and my worst students.
Some of them who had better performance -- they didn't have <unk> <unk>
Some of my smartest children were not doing so well.
And that got me thinking.
The kind of thing you need to learn in mathematics in seventh grade, sure, are <unk> <unk> <unk> the area of a <unk>
But these concepts aren't impossible and I was very convinced that every one of my students could learn if they were working hard and during time for enough.
After many years of <unk> I came to the conclusion that what we need in education is a better understanding of students and learning from a <unk> perspective, from a psychological perspective.
In education, the only thing we know how to measure better ways.
It's the <unk> but what if you succeed in school and life depends on much more than the ability to learn how fast and easy?
So I left the classroom and I went to college to become a <unk>
I started studying kids and adults on all sorts of <unk> <unk> and in every study my question was, who is successful here and why?
My research team and I went to the Academy <unk> West <unk>
We tried to predict what <unk> <unk> in military training and who would be <unk>
We went to the National <unk> National <unk> and we tried to predict what children are going to be able to get away in the competition.
We studied teachers who are working in really difficult neighborhoods working in really difficult neighborhoods, which teachers will still be teaching for the end of the year and <unk> who will be the most effective to improve the learning results of their <unk>
Do we partnered with private companies, ask yourself, what about these marketers are going to keep their <unk>
And who is going to make more money?
In all these very different contexts, emerged a feature as an important <unk> of success.
And it wasn't the social intelligence.
It wasn't the good look, the physical health, and it wasn't the I.Q.
It was <unk>
<unk> is passion and <unk> to achieve long-term goals.
<unk> is to have resistance.
<unk> is clinging to your future, day after day, not only for the week, not only for the month, but for years and working hard to make that future a reality.
<unk> is to live life as if it was a <unk> not a career at all.
A few years ago, I started studying determination in public schools in Chicago.
I asked thousands of high school students to make my habit <unk> and then I waited about over a year to see who was <unk>
It turns out that children with more determination was significantly higher than even as the <unk> in every feature that I could measure, things like family income, the results of the evidence -- even the security results that they felt when they were in school.
So it's not only in West Point or in the National <unk> of <unk> where <unk> is also in school, especially for children at risk of <unk>
For me, the most shocking thing about determination is the little thing that we know about the science of their development.
Every day, parents and teachers ask me, "How can I develop determination for children?
What do I have to do to teach kids a solid ethic of work?
How do I keep them motivated for the long <unk>
The most honest answer is, I don't know.  What I know is that talent is not <unk>
Our data shows very clearly that there are many talented individuals that are simply not going ahead with their <unk>
In fact, in our data, the determination of commonly commonly related or even related to backwards measures of talent.
So far, the best idea I've ever heard about developing people's determination is something called <unk> <unk>
This is an idea that was developed at Stanford University for Carol <unk> and it's the belief that the ability to learn is not yet that it can change with the effort.
Dr. <unk> has shown that when kids read and learn about the brain and how it changes and it grows in response to the challenge, they're much more likely to <unk> when they fail, because they don't think that failure is a permanent condition.
So the mindset mindset is a great idea to develop <unk>
But we need more.
And that's where I finished my speech, because that's where we are.
That's the work that we have to go.
We need to take our best ideas, our stronger intuitions and we need to <unk>
We need to measure if they've been successful and we need to be willing to fail, to <unk> to start all over again with the lessons <unk>
In other words, we need to be certain about making our children more <unk>
Thank you.
<unk> in Taiwan as the daughter of a <unk> one of my most <unk> memories is my mother <unk> the beauty, the shape and the shape of Chinese characters.
From that moment, I was scared by this incredible language.
But for a foreigner. It seems to be as <unk> as the Great Wall of China.
In the last few years, I've been wondering if I can break down this <unk> so that I want to understand and appreciate the beauty of this sophisticated language can do it.
I started thinking about how a new way of learning is going to be helpful.
Since I was five years old, I started to learn how to draw each of the strokes in every character in the right sequence.
I learned new characters every day for the next 15 years.
Since we only have five minutes, it's better than we do it in a faster and simple way.
A Chinese academic <unk> 20 characters.
You just need a thousand to understand basic awareness.
The first 200 will allow you to understand 40 percent of the basic literature, long enough to read signals, <unk> <unk> to understand the basic idea of pages or newspapers.
Today we start with eight to show you how the method works.
Are you ready?
You open your mouth as much as it might be possible until it is <unk>
They get a mouth.
This is a person who's going to give a walk.
<unk>
If the shape of the fire is a person with arms on both sides, as if I were yelling at a <unk> <unk> I'm <unk> This symbol is actually <unk> in the form of it, but I like to believe it is the other way that it will work.
This is a tree.
tree tree.
This is a mountain.
The sun.
The moon.
The <unk> symbol looks like a couple of doors of a <unk> in the old West.
I call these eight characters.
They are building blocks so that they create a lot more characters.
One person.
If you walk behind, that's <unk>
As the old said, two are a company, three are <unk>
If one person stretches your arms, this person is saying <unk> this big thing.
The person inside the mouth, the person is <unk>
It's a prisoner's dilemma, like <unk> inside the whale.
A tree is a tree -- two trees together, we have a forest.
Three trees together, we have the forest.
Put a chart under the tree, we have the <unk>
Put a mouth on the tree, that's a <unk>  <unk> of remember, because a tree tree is quite an idiot.
Remember the fire?
Two girls together, it gets very hot.
Three each one of them are a lot of fire.
Put the fire under the two trees, that's <unk>
For us, the sun is the source of prosperity.
Two <unk> together, <unk>
Three together, those are <unk>
Put the sun and the moon shining together, that's the <unk>
It also means tomorrow, after one day and one night.
The sun comes out on the <unk> horizon.
One door. Put a board inside the door, it's the <unk> of the door.
Put a mouth inside the door, asking questions.
Is there somebody at home?
This person is coming out of a gate, <unk> <unk>
On the left, we have a woman.
Two women together, they're <unk>
Three women together, they're <unk>
So we've already been through almost 30 characters.
When you use this method, the first eight radical eight will allow them to build 32.
The next group of eight characters will build other 32.
So with every little effort, they're going to be able to learn a couple hundred characters, which is the same thing you learn a Chinese for eight years.
So after knowing the characters, we started to create sentences.
For example, the mountain and the fire together, we have a mountain of fire. It's a <unk>
We know that Japan is the land of the sun <unk>
This is a sun placed with the beginning, because Japan is to this China.
So a sun next to it, we created Japan.
One person behind Japan, what do we have?
A Japanese person.
The character on the left is two mountains stacked over the other.
In the ancient China, that meant in exile, because Chinese <unk> <unk> their political enemies beyond the mountains.
Today, the <unk> has become date.
A mouth that tells you where it is a <unk>
This is a slide to remind me that I have to stop talking and down the stage. Thank you.
What I prefer to be a dad is the movies I get to see.
I love to share my favorite films with my <unk> when my daughter was four years old, we saw the <unk> of Oz together.
The film was his imagination for months.
His favorite character was <unk> of course.
He gave him a good excuse to use a bright dress and bring a magic wand, and <unk>
But when you see that film so many times, you get to understand that it's extraordinary.
We now live and we raised our children in a kind of industrial complex display shows in a <unk>
However, the magician magician was an event itself.
It doesn't start that trend.
The trend really took over 40 years later with, interestingly, another film whose <unk> a metal kid and a <unk> kid would join a girl in her as a <unk>
Do you know what I'm talking about?
There's a big difference between these two films, there are a couple of big differences between the <unk> and all the movies that we see today.
One is that there are very little violence in the <unk> <unk>
The monkeys are quite aggressive, like <unk>
But I think if the magician magician did today, the magician would say, <unk> you're the salvation of Oz as the prophecy.
<unk> magic shoes to defeat the military has been used by evil <unk>
But that's not what happens.
Another one of the only one of the world's most wise characters and even <unk> are women.
I started to notice this when I made Star Trek to my daughter, a few years later, and the situation was different.
At that moment, I also had a son.
Just three years.
It wasn't invited to the projection because it was still very small for that.
But it was the second son, and the supervision of oversight had <unk>  And so slid in the room and I was dressed in the room of my <unk> behind, and I don't think he understood what was happening, but it was <unk> <unk> everything.
I wonder what <unk>
They would be <unk> and <unk> and <unk>
It should be a sense that Luke was one to an army to <unk> the government?
<unk> this with the <unk> <unk>
How do you win Dorothy his movie?
<unk> <unk> with all and being a <unk>
It's the kind of world that I want my kids to grow up to grow up, and not a world of men who <unk> which is where we are.
Why is there that so much force -- no force in the movies for our children, and so little out of the way of <unk> <unk>
There's a lot of literature about the impact of male violence in male violence in the girls, and they should be <unk> It's very good.
I haven't read so much about how kids react to this encouragement.
I know the experience that Princess <unk> doesn't give me the proper framework that would have served to navigate the world of adults who are <unk>  I think at the time of the first kiss I really hoped that they were going to start to appear because it's the end of the movie, right?
My search is finished, I have <unk>
Why are they standing there?
I don't know what I should do.
<unk> focus on defeat <unk> and get their reward, and they don't leave time for other relationships or other <unk>
It's almost like a child, you have to be a <unk> animal, and if you're a girl, you have to use a <unk> suit.
There are many exceptions, and to defend the Disney from Disney to any of you.
But they send a message to the children, even though them, they are not really their goal.
They make a phenomenal job when you teach girls how to defend their <unk> but they don't necessarily show kids how to defend the <unk>
There is no model for them.
We also have a few great women who write new stories for our children, so real and lovely as <unk> and <unk> but they don't stop being a war movies.
Of course, the most successful theme of all times is coming up by appearing in classic after classic each of them on the adventures of a child or a man, or two men who are friends, or a man and his son, or two men who are raised a child.
Until many of you are thinking, this year, we finally came up with it.
I recommend all of you. It's already available in stores.
Do you remember what the criticism said when he came out <unk>
I can't believe that Pixar is made a movie of a <unk>
It's very good. Don't let me get it.
Well, almost none of these films happens by <unk>
I don't know if you've heard about this.
There's still no roots and already <unk> but maybe we're going to start a movement.
<unk> <unk> is a comic book artist, and in the <unk> I recorded a conversation that had had with a friend of <unk> of the movies that you saw.
And it's very simple. There are only three questions that must be <unk> in the movie, there's more than a female character who has lines?
So let me get the <unk>
These women are talking to each other at some point in the movie?
Their conversations are about something more than the kid who are so much like this?  Okay? Thank you.  Thank you very much.
Two women that exist and talk about things each other.
<unk> I've seen -- and yet very rarely I see it in the cinema that we know and love.
In fact, this week I went to see a very good quality, <unk>
Right? <unk> of <unk> success -- a consensus idea of what's a Hollywood Hollywood movie.
<unk> doesn't happen to <unk>
And I don't think I think <unk> because a lot of the movie, I don't know if you've seen, a lot of the film happens in a <unk> where men and women hide during the <unk> crisis.
We have many scenes of men who have deep and painful conversations on this <unk> and it's the great time for one of the actors, to take a look at the door and say, "Save the bed, <unk>
This is Hollywood.
So let's go through the numbers.
In 2011, in 100 most popular films, how many of them believe they have actors <unk>
<unk> It's not bad.
It's not the same percentage that the number of women we've chosen recently for Congress, then it's okay.
But there's a larger number that this is going to be <unk> this room.
The New York Times was published a study that the government had done.
This is what he said, <unk>
In the United States, one in five women says it has been sexually assaulted once in their life.
I don't think it's the fault of mass entertainment.
I don't think the movies for children have something to do with that.
Nor do I think music or pornography are closely <unk> but something is wrong, and when I hear that statistics, one of the things that I think is that there's a lot of sex <unk>
Who are those <unk> What are those <unk>
What do they don't get <unk>
They're <unk> the story that the role of a male hero is to defeat <unk> with violence and then charge the reward, which is a woman who has no friends and not <unk>
We are <unk> that story?
You know, as a father with the privilege of raising a daughter like those of you who are doing the same thing, we found this world and this very alarming statistic and we want to <unk>
We have tools to our disposal as <unk> <unk> and we hope that we have to ask that, but I have to ask, <unk> <unk> is going to <unk> if, at the same time, active or <unk> we're educating our children to keep their own power.
I mean, I think the Netflix list is a way to do something really important, and here I mean primarily to parents.
I think we need to show our children a new definition of <unk>
The definition of the masculinity is radically changing.
You'll have read about how the new economy is changing the role that we care about home and <unk>
Everything is changing.
When I asked my daughter who was his favorite <unk> cartoon character -- you know, you know what he meant.
<unk>
<unk> <unk> and <unk>
What are these two?
Maybe it's not just the brilliant dress.
I think they're experts.
I think these are the two people in those films that know more than anyone, and they love to share their knowledge with other people to help us reach their potential.
They are leaders.
I like that kind of stories for my daughter, and I like that kind of stories for my son.
I want more stories like that.
I want less stories in which I tell my <unk> Go and struggle only and more stories where his job is to join a team, maybe a team led by women, helping other people better and be better people, like the magician <unk>
Thank you.
I was living in Maine, I lived in Maine, and one of the things that I was more like was to look at sea cookies on the shores of Maine because my parents told me that I would give me lucky.
But you know, it's hard to find these <unk>
They're covered in sand and it's hard to see them.
And yet, with time, I was terrified of <unk>
I started to see shapes and patterns that helped me <unk>
This became a passion for finding things, in love for the past and Afghanistan.
And finally when I started studying <unk> I realized that I saw with my own eyes wasn't enough.
Because suddenly in Egypt, my little beach in Maine had grown up to a almost 1.3 mile of length by the <unk>
And my sea biscuits had grown to the size of cities.
This is really what led me to use satellite images.
To try to make a map of the past, I knew I had to see it differently.
I want to show you an example of how different we see when you use the <unk>
This is a place located in the eastern Coast Coast of Egypt called <unk>
And the place, to simple sight, seems to be brown but when we use infrared and we're going to process it using <unk> and suddenly the place looks like <unk>
What you're seeing is the real chemical changes in the <unk> of the <unk> of building materials and the activities of the ancient Egyptian.
I want to share with you how we've used satellite data to find a former old city, called <unk> lost for thousands of years.
<unk> was the old Egypt of Egypt for over 400 years in a period of time called the Middle Empire about 4,000 years ago.
The place lies in the <unk> Egypt, and it's really important because in the world world, there was this great renaissance of ancient art <unk> architecture and religion.
<unk> have always known that <unk> was located somewhere near the pyramids of the two kings that <unk> <unk> inside the red circles here, but somewhere inside this enormous <unk>
This area is large, it's about <unk> by <unk>
Before, the Nile <unk> right next to the <unk> and as it changed over time, it moved to the time and covered the entire city.
So how do you find a city <unk> in a <unk> landscape.
And I'll try to try and find it going to be the equivalent of a needle in a <unk> with the <unk> eyes, and using baseball <unk>
So we use NASA data to make a map of place, with very subtle changes.
We were able to see where the <unk> <unk>
But you can see more <unk> and it's even more interesting, this slightly high area that looks inside the circle here, which we think could be the location of <unk>
So we collaborated with the Egyptian scientists doing <unk> jobs you can see here.
When I say <unk> it's like the sample of sample in ice, but instead of layers of climate change, we look for layers of human occupation for us.
Five feet down, underneath a thick thick layer of <unk> we found a dense layer of <unk> objects.
This means that in this possible location of <unk> five feet down, we have a layer of occupation of several hundreds of years that date from the world, exactly the same period we think is <unk>
We also found <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> what proves that there was a <unk> shop.
This might seem like it's not a lot, but when we think about the most common stones used in jewelry in the Middle Empire. These are the stones that are <unk>
So, we have a dense layer of occupation that goes back from the Middle Empire.
We also have evidence of a jewelry workshop who shows that what I've been there, was a very important city.
We still don't find <unk> here, but we will get to the place in a future near <unk>
And even more importantly, we have the resources to train young Egyptians in the use of satellite technology so that they can also perform great discoveries.
I want to finish with my favorite quote from the Ottoman Empire and it probably was written in <unk> 4,000 years ago.
Now share knowledge is the biggest of all <unk>
There's nothing like that on the ground.
So according to it, TED was not founded in 1984 <unk> C.
Do the ideas come really started in 1984 BC.
It certainly puts the pursuit of <unk> in perspective.
Thank you very much.
Thank you.
I want to invite you to close your eyes.
Imagine standing out in front of the door to <unk> home.
I want you to pay attention to the color of the door, to the material that he's made.
Now <unk> a <unk> group in bicycles.
They are competing in a <unk> race and go direction to your front door.
I need to see this <unk>
They are strong, they're <unk> they're <unk>
They collide in front of their door against their home.
Is it bicycles flying everywhere, wheels that go on on your side, rays from the wheels that end up in the <unk> places -- the threshold of the door, you know.
By the lobby, the hall, or what there is on the other side of the door, and look at the quality of the light -- the light shining on the <unk> of the <unk>
It's waving with the hand.
From his chair, on a brown horse.
It's a horse that talks about.
You can feel your blue <unk> by making it on your nose.
You can smell the <unk> <unk> and you go that is about to get into the mouth.
<unk> on one side and enter your living room.
In the room, and doing most of their imagination, imagine Britney <unk>
He's with little clothes, dancing on his center <unk> singing <unk> <unk> One More <unk>
Now let's go to the kitchen.
The land has been coated with a path of yellow brick and from the oven, come to you -- the Man of <unk> the <unk> and the <unk> of "The Wizard of <unk> <unk> of the hands, jumping towards you.
Okay. Open your eyes.
I want to tell you about a peculiar contest that takes place every spring in New York City.
It's called the <unk> <unk> of the United States."
I was to cover this event a few years ago as a journalist journalist, to say, I suppose, I guess, this was like the end of a <unk> of <unk>
There were several men and a few of the different ages and different habits of hygiene.
They were <unk> hundreds of numbers, look at them just once.
<unk> the names of dozens and tens of strangers.
They had entire poems in just minutes.
<unk> to see who could memorize much faster fast, the order of a deck of <unk>
And I was like, "This is <unk>
These people must be phenomena of nature.
And I started talking to some of the competitors.
This one is a man named Ed <unk> who had come from England and who has one of the best <unk> memories.
I said, <unk> when you realized you were a <unk>
Ed <unk> "I am not a wise.
Actually, I have a average memory.
Everybody who relies on this competition say they have normal memory.
"We have been trained to perform these miraculous acts of memory using some old <unk> -- invented a half thousand years ago in Greece, the same techniques I used <unk> to memorize their speeches and the <unk> academics used to memorize <unk> books.
And my reaction was: How did I have no heard of this <unk>
We were standing outside of the room of competition, and <unk> who is a wonderful and brilliant English room -- even though a little bit <unk> he said, <unk> you are an American dream.
You know Britney <unk>
And I said, "What? No, why?
Because I'd like to teach Britney <unk> how to memorize the order on a deck of cards in live, in national television.
That would prove to the world that anybody can do it."
And I said, "Well, I'm not Britney <unk> but maybe you can teach me to me.
I mean, you have to start for something not?"
And that was the beginning of a very strange journey for me.
And I ended up spending most of the year, not only training my memory, but also <unk> trying to understand how it works, why sometimes it doesn't work and what their potential.
I met a lot of really interesting people.
This is a man named <unk>
He's <unk> very probably with the worst memory in the world.
His memory was so bad that I didn't even know that I had a problem of <unk> it's amazing.
Somebody was incredibly tragic, but it was a window that allows you to see to what about our memory we are.
On the other end of the spectrum, I met this man.
This is Kim <unk> In he was based on the <unk> <unk> <unk> movie <unk>
We went one afternoon in the public library in Salt Lake City, <unk> guides -- was <unk>
And at the back, a number of treaties on the memory written over 2,000 years ago in Latin, in the <unk> and then in the Middle Ages.
And I learned a lot of really interesting things.
One of the most interesting things that I learned is that there was a time when this idea of having the <unk> and disciplined memory -- it wasn't a little bit as rare as it can look like today.
A long time ago, people invest in their memory, to provide their minds.
These techniques have made our modern world, but they also have changed.
They have changed <unk> and I would say that they have changed as well.
As we already have no need to remember, sometimes it seems like we've forgotten how to do it.
One of the last places on our planet where people are still passionate about this idea of a <unk> memory and disciplined memory is this very unique competition of memory.
It's actually not that <unk> there are <unk> like this in the world.
I was <unk> I wanted to know how these people do.
A few years ago, a group of researchers from University College London invited a group of memory champions in the lab.
They wanted to know: Is it going to be a brains in a way, structural or <unk> different from the rest of us?
The answer was, no.
Are they smarter than <unk>
They gave them a cognitive test, and the answer was actually no.
And yet, a really interesting difference and significant difference between the brains of memory and the subjects of control with the <unk>
When they put them in a MRI machine, you know, <unk> your brains while they <unk> numbers, faces and forms of <unk> they found that in the memory champions are <unk> parts of the brain, different to others.
In effect, they <unk> or they seemed <unk> a part of the brain that involves spatial memory and navigation.
Why? There's something we can learn from this?
The tournament for competitive <unk> is running as a race race in which every year appears to someone with a new way of remembering more things, more quickly, and then the rest of competitors should be <unk>
This is my friend Ben <unk> three times memory.
In his desk, in front of him, there are 36 years old, and he said, <unk> that he's about to try to memorize an hour, using a technique that he invented and only he <unk>
He used a similar technique to memorize the very precise order of <unk> digits <unk>
A half hour. Yeah.
And while there's a huge amount of ways to remember things in these <unk> absolutely all the techniques used to the end of a single concept that psychologists call <unk> <unk>
It illustrates with a elegant paradox known as the paradox <unk> <unk> says the following: I say to two people who remember the same word -- I tell you to you, you know, there's a man named <unk>
That's his <unk>
And then I ask you, <unk> there's a <unk> <unk>
And when I return later, and I ask them, I wonder that word I told you about a <unk>
<unk> <unk>
The person who has told him that his name is Baker is unlikely to remember the same word that the person who has told her work is <unk>
The same word, different capacity to <unk> that is weird.
What happens here?
Well, the name Baker, actually doesn't mean anything to you. It doesn't have any relationship to you.
With all the other memories I dance on their head.
But the word, <unk> We know <unk>
They use <unk> white <unk>
They have <unk> on their hands.
They were very well when they come home to work.
Probably <unk> some <unk>
And when you get that word for the first time, we started putting <unk> <unk> for <unk> <unk> at some point back.
One of the most elaborate techniques to do this half a thousand years ago in Greece <unk>
It's known as the <unk> of the <unk>
The story says, there was a poet named <unk> who attended a <unk>
They had hired as entertainment, because before, if I wanted to give a very good party, they didn't bring to a <unk> they would get a <unk>
He stood up with him, <unk> his memory poem, and he was <unk> and as soon as it was, the classroom was <unk>
<unk> everybody.
But it didn't only kill everybody, but it shattered the <unk> bodies of it.
No one could say who was there, nobody could remember where they were sitting.
So they could not be <unk> <unk>
One tragedy behind the other.
He stopped standing outside, only surviving in the middle of the rubble, closed the eyes and realized that with his eyes in his mind, I could see where he had been sitting every single hand.
I took the family of the hand <unk> where they were their loved ones between the rubble.
What you're going to pick you in that moment is something that we all know more or less <unk> and that is that no matter whether we're not good to remember names or phone numbers, or the word numbers for the word of our colleagues, we have visual memory and space memory.
If I told you that I would give you the first 10 words of history that I just told you about <unk> is very likely to find them very difficult to do it.
But I would bet that if you asked them to tell you who was sitting on the brown speaker horse in his lobby, they would be able to <unk>
The idea of the memory of memory is to create this building with the eyes of their mind and <unk> from images with the things that you want to remember.
This is a advice that comes from more than 2,000 years ago, to the first memory <unk> in <unk>
And how does it work?
So let's say you have been invited to the TED stage to give a talk and you want to do it memory, the same way that I would have done it, if you would have invited him to <unk> it 2,000 years ago.
What you might do is imagine you're at the door of your home.
And to come up with some kind of absolutely ridiculous, crazy crazy image, to help them remember that the first thing you want to mention is that completely <unk> competition.
And then you can imagine entering your house, and see the <unk> of the <unk> <unk>
And that will remind you that you want to introduce your friend Ed <unk>
And then you would see Britney <unk> to remind you that funny anecdote that you want to count.
And then in the kitchen, and the fourth subject that they will talk to would be that strange journey that they did for a whole year, and they have some friends to help you remember it.
That's like the <unk> speakers <unk> his narratives -- not word for word, which is going to confuse us as typical for typical.
In fact, the term <unk> comes from the Greek <unk> which means <unk>
It's a <unk> when people thought about the <unk> and in the rhetoric with this kind of spatial terms.
The phrase <unk> first <unk> would be like the first place in his memory.
I saw this was just amazing, and I got into that.
I went to some of these memory and I had the idea of writing something long about this <unk> <unk> <unk>
But there was a problem.
The problem was that a memory competition is a <unk> event.
So seriously, it's like seeing a bunch of people sitting around taking exams. I mean, the most exciting thing that happens is when someone would get off the front.
I'm a journalist and I need to write about something.
I know there are amazing things happening in the minds of these people, but I don't have access.
I realized that if I was going to tell this story, I needed to try to put myself in the place.
So I began to spend 15 or 20 minutes every morning, before I sit to see the New York Times, just trying to remember something.
Maybe a poem. Or the names of an old school <unk> school in a <unk> market.
And I discovered that this was a chance to get fun.
I would never have expected to be able to do it.
It was fun, because it wasn't just about training memory.
What is actually about doing is better and more the ability to create and imagine these <unk> images -- <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and hopefully <unk> in the eye of the mind.
I was very hooked on this.
This is me, using my standard team training for memory competition.
It's a couple of <unk> and a little bit of security games with tape leaving only two <unk> because the tsunami is the worst enemy of a memory of memory.
And I ended up coming back to the same contest that had covered a year before. He had the idea that I could put it into a kind of <unk> <unk> experiment.
I thought this could be good <unk> for all of my research.
The problem was that the experiment came out of control.
And I won the <unk> something that I didn't have to happen.
Of course, it's cute power to memorize narratives and phone numbers, but actually this is not the point.
These are just just tricks.
Because they are based on very basic principles about how the brain works.
And you don't need to be able to build <unk> of memory or memorize <unk> <unk> to benefit with a little bit of insight, about how your mind works.
We often talk about people with a great memory as if it was a gift of a <unk> but it's not the case.
The big memories are <unk>
At the most basic level, we remember when we pay attention.
So let's think about it, when we focus it deeply.
The palace of <unk> These memory techniques are just shortcuts.
In fact, they're not even <unk>
They work because they make us <unk>
And we had a kind of deep processing, a kind of complete attention that most of you are not <unk> out there.
But the reality is that there's no shortcuts.
That's how things get <unk>
And if there is something that I want to leave you with today, is what <unk> <unk> I couldn't even remember that I had a memory problem, I left me, which is the notion that life is the sum of our memories.
How much are we willing to lose what is already our short existence <unk> in the <unk> or <unk> not paying attention to the human being in front of us, who walks up to our side, we will be so <unk> that we don't even believe in process <unk>
I learned firsthand that there are amazing memory capacities in all of us.
But if you want to live a healthy life, you must be the kind of person you remember remember.
Thank you.
I'm going to talk to you about the last 30 years of the history of architecture.
It's a lot to cover in 18 minutes.
It's a complex issue, so we can just take a <unk> place in New Jersey.
Because 30 years ago, I am from <unk>
In the corner, from my bedroom, I was the toilet that I shared with my sister.
And in my bedroom and the bathroom, there was a balcony that gave the living room.
And there they all spent the time watching television -- so every time I was going from my room to the bathroom, everybody looked at me, and every time I got married, and I was going to go back in a towel -- everybody looked at me.
And I was like this.
I was <unk> no, and I hated it.
I hated that journey, hated that <unk> hated that room and that house.
That's the architecture.
That's right.
Those feelings, those emotions that I felt, is that architecture is the power of architecture, because architecture is not about mathematics, no division of areas, but of those connections, emotional connections, which we feel in the places that are <unk>
And it's not surprising that we feel like that, because according to the Environmental Protection Agency -- Americans spend 90 percent of their time under roof.
I mean, 90 percent of the time we're surrounded by architecture.
That's a lot.
So architecture determines us in ways that we don't even get to account.
It makes us a little naive and very, very predictable.
So this means that when I show you a building like this, I know what you asked them to think about <unk> <unk> and <unk>
And I know what you think about it for based on a building built a thousand years ago by the Greeks.
This is a trick.
It's a <unk> using architects to create an emotional connection with the ways that we build our buildings.
It's an emotional emotional connection, we've used this trick for a long time, a long time.
We use it 200 years ago to build banks.
We use it in the 19th century to build art museums.
And in the 20th century, we use it to build houses.
See, these <unk> stable, <unk> in front of the sea, away from the elements.
This is very, very useful, because building things is terrifying.
It's expensive, it takes a lot of time and it's very complicated.
People who are <unk> and governments are always afraid of innovation, and they prefer to use ways that you know they're going to work.
So we met with buildings like this.
It's a nice <unk>
This is the Public Library of <unk> which was finished in 2004, in my hometown, and you know, it has this <unk> thing -- it has this <unk> thing -- the columns, the red brick -- which <unk> what <unk> is trying to communicate with this <unk> children, the values of property, the story.
But it doesn't have a lot to do with a library today.
That same year, in 2004, on the other side of the country, came up with another library, which looks like this.
It's in Seattle.
This library shows how we use media in the digital age.
It's a new kind of public equipment for the city, a place to come together, reading and sharing.
So how is it possible that in the same year, in the same country, two buildings, both so-called libraries, are so completely different?
And the answer is that architecture works according to the beginning of the <unk>
On one side is the <unk> the architects that constantly drive new technologies, new <unk> new solutions for today's life.
We were going to get we made and we <unk> so much that we get away from the people.
Every black of the black, this is <unk> you think we feel very well, but we're dead because we have no other option.
We need to go to the other side and go back to these symbols <unk>
So we do that, and we're all happy, but we are all happy, but we start experimenting with <unk> so we started experimenting with <unk> and over and over again, we've done this in the last 300 years, and of course it is, in the last 30 years.
Well, 30 years ago in the '70s.
The architects were busy experimenting with so-called <unk>
It has to do with the concrete.
That can be guess.
<unk> little, <unk> scale.
Something really hard.
So we get to the 1980s, and we started to incorporate those symbols.
<unk> the pendulum again in the other direction.
We take those ways that we know like and <unk>
<unk> <unk> and we added loads of new materials.
I love it.
We don't give <unk>
We took <unk> <unk> and we become a skyscraper that can be <unk> <unk> made out of glass.
The shapes became <unk> won in boldness and <unk>
<unk> became columns.
<unk> grew up to the size of buildings.
It's crazy.
But it was the 1980s, that was great.
We all spend time in commercial malls we moved to the neighborhoods, and there in the suburbs, we can create our own erotic <unk>
Those fantasies could be <unk> to the French or the Italian <unk>
It might be a <unk> of bread.
This is what happens with <unk>
This is what happens with symbols.
They're easy, because instead of creating new spaces, we visualize memories of other places.
I know very well, and you all know, this is not the <unk>
This is Ohio.
architects feel frustrated and we started to make the pendulum again in the other direction.
In the '80s and early '90s, we started experimenting with so-called <unk>
<unk> the symbols <unk> we now have new new design techniques now we have new design techniques -- and we found new <unk> a few ways that are <unk> against other forms.
This is academic and <unk> and it's super <unk> You get totally <unk>
Normally, the <unk> <unk> again in the opposite direction.
But then, something <unk>
In 1997, it opened this building.
It's the <unk> of Frank <unk>
This building fundamentally changed the relationship of the world with architecture.
Paul <unk> said Bilbao was one of those rare moments when <unk> academics and public and general in general, were completely known about a building.
The New York Times <unk> this construction of <unk>
<unk> in Bilbao grew up in a half thousand people when they finished the building.
So suddenly, everybody wanted one of those <unk> Los Angeles, Seattle, Chicago, New York, Cleveland, <unk>
Everyone wanted one, and Gehry was everywhere.
He was our first native architect,
But how is it possible that these <unk> and <unk> how it's possible to become ubiquitous around the world?
And it happened -- because the media was <unk> around them and quickly learned that those forms meant culture and tourism.
We've created an emotional reaction with these forms.
Same thing made the major mayors in the world.
So everybody believed that if they had these forms, they had culture and tourism.
This phenomenon of the beginning of the new <unk> country with other architects star.
It went to <unk> and <unk> and what happened with these few examples of elite architects in the threshold of the new millennium, actually started to move through all the architecture, digital media began to increase the speed of information consumption.
Think about how use architecture.
A thousand years ago, you'd have to walk up to the next town to see a building.
<unk> are <unk> you can take a boat, an airplane, can be <unk>
<unk> technology, you can see in the newspapers, on TV, and in the end, we're all photographers from architecture, and the building is carried beyond their physical location.
The architecture is everywhere, that means that the speed of communications has finally achieved the speed of architecture.
Because architecture moves so fast.
It doesn't really happen to think about a building.
It takes a lot of time to build a building, three or four years, and at that time, an architect can design two, eight, or 100 more buildings -- before I knew if the one who designed four years ago was a success or not.
Because there has never been good feedback in architecture.
That's how we met buildings like this.
The <unk> was not a <unk> movement for 20 years.
For 20 years, we were building buildings like this because we had no idea how much <unk>
That's never going to be going back to happen, <unk> because we're at the threshold of the largest revolution in architecture from the invention of the <unk> of the <unk> or the <unk> and the media revolution.
My theory is that when it applies to the pendulum of communication, it starts swing faster and faster, until it will be on both extremes almost in <unk> and it is effectively <unk> the difference between innovation and symbol, between us, the architects, and you know, the public.
Now we can make symbols almost <unk> with emotional burden of something completely new.
I'm going to show you how the system works in a project that my company ended up recently.
We were <unk> to replace this building that was <unk>
This is the center of a village called <unk> in <unk> Island, in the state of New York City.
It's a holiday community.
But that meant two years before the building ended up the building, it was already part of the community, and as the drawings looked at exactly the product done, it wasn't surprises.
The building came to be part of the community -- that first summer, when people began to get and share it in social media, the building stopped being just a building, it became a media, because these are not just images of a building, they are the images that one made of the building.
And as you use it to tell your story, they become part of the personal narrative -- and that makes it <unk> with collective memory, and by bringing these symbols, we learn.
I mean, we don't need Greeks to tell us how to think of architecture.
We can tell each other what we think about architecture, because digital media hasn't only changed the relationship between us, but have changed the relationship between us and buildings.
Think for a second in those librarians of <unk>
If that building was built, first of course, <unk> the Internet for <unk> <unk>
<unk> bombarded with examples of <unk> of innovation, what it can be a library.
That's <unk>
<unk> that you can take the mayor of <unk> to the people of <unk> and tell them that there are no unique answer to what a library can be today.
Let's be part of this.
This abundance of solutions gives freedom to experience.
It's all different now.
The architects are no longer these mysterious creatures that are using <unk> and complicated, and you're not a <unk> public that doesn't embrace anything that has never seen before.
The architects may listen, and you don't have to blame ourselves by architecture.
That means that the <unk> <unk> of one style to another, is irrelevant.
In fact, we can go ahead and find appropriate solutions to the problems facing society.
This is the end of the history of architecture, and it means that the buildings in the morning will be very different to the buildings today.
This means that a public space in the ancient city of <unk> can be unique and adapted to the measure of a modern city.
This means that a stadium in Brooklyn can be that, a stadium in Brooklyn, and not a bad <unk> historical brick of red brick in ideas of what a <unk>
This means that a few robots will be able to build our buildings, because we will ultimately be ready for the shapes that will produce.
That means that the buildings were <unk> to the whims of nature and not the opposite.
This means that a parking garage, this means that a parking garage, it can also serve for sports or for <unk> or even you can marry there at night.
This means that three architects can dream with swimming in the East Side of New York, and to raise half a million dollars of the community attached to that cause, it's not a customer alone.
It means that no building is too small to innovation, like this little <unk> of <unk> so <unk> and <unk> like the animals that are going to observe.
Because it doesn't matter whether it's a cow or a robot who builds our buildings.
It doesn't matter how we built, which matters is what we've built.
Architects already know how to make buildings more and smarter and more kind.
We've been waiting for all of you.
Finally, we're not on the opposite side.
Find an architect, <unk> and <unk> together to make better buildings, better cities, for a better world, because there's a lot of play.
The buildings not only reflect our society, but they give it way to the most <unk> spaces, local libraries -- the homes where our children, we go to our children, and the <unk> to the bathroom.
Thank you very much.
This is my <unk> <unk>
It just turned a year and started walking.
And it makes it very typical of the children of a year, <unk> as if his body was moving too fast for their legs.
It's totally <unk>
And one of the things that you like to do for the moment is look at the mirror.
She really loves his reflection.
It <unk> and <unk> and it gives itself these big kisses and <unk>
It's beautiful.
And apparently, all of his friends do this and my mom tells me that I used to do it, and he asked me to think, when stop doing this?
How is it that we suddenly aren't <unk> with our <unk>
Because, apparently, we don't like it.
Every month, 10,000 people are looking at Google: "I'm <unk>
This is <unk> he's 13 years old and lives in <unk>
And as any teenager only wants to be dear and fit in.
It's Sunday at night.
He's preparing for the next week in school.
It has a little bit of fear, it's a little confused because, although her mom tells her all the time it's beautiful, every day in school, someone tells you it's ugly.
Among what your mom says and what his friends, or fellow of the school would say, doesn't know who to believe.
So a video of her own, he publishes it on YouTube, and he asks others to give a <unk> "I'm pretty nice, I'm a <unk>
Well, until now, <unk> has gotten more than 13,000 <unk>
Some of these are so <unk> that it doesn't even deserve to think about them.
We talk about a normal and ordinary teenager who gets these answers on one of the stages of their life more vulnerable emotionally.
Thousands of people are posting videos like this, in most of the teenage girls trying to communicate this way.
But what is it driving to do this?
Well, the teenagers today are almost never alone.
They're under pressure of being online and available all the time, talking to <unk> by giving <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> -- this is never over.
Never before we've been so connected, in a continuous way, so they were so young.
As a mother said, "It's like there's a party in your room all the <unk>
There's just no privacy.
And the social pressures that go from the hand with that are <unk>
This environment, being always connected, is <unk> our children to <unk> based on the number of likes that they have and the kinds of comments that they get.
There is no divide between a life online and real life.
It's really hard to know the differences between what's real or what it isn't.
And also, it's very difficult to know the difference between what is authentic and what will be rigged digitally.
What is the hardest thing in the life of someone in front of what is normal in a every day?
And where are they looking for <unk>
Well, you can see the kind of images that are <unk> from the news of girls now.
<unk> <unk> continue to dominate our <unk>
The <unk> technique is a routine.
And trends like, <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk>
So for those of you who <unk> <unk> means <unk>
These trends are associated with women in popular culture today.
It's not very hard to see what the young people you hear.
But kids aren't really immune to this.
like the superheroes of the sports <unk> and the singers <unk>
But what's the problem with all this?
Well, surely we want our children to grow healthy and be individuals right now.
But in a culture obsessed by the image, we're teaching our children to spend more time and mental effort to their appearance, at the price of all other aspects of their identity.
Things like their relationships, the development of their physical skills, their studies and other aspects begin to suffer.
Six from every 10 girls prefer not to do something because they think they don't see nice enough.
These are not <unk> activities.
They are fundamental activities for their growth as human beings and as human beings and the field of labor development.
31 percent, almost one of the three teenagers are not interested in class debates -- to participate in the classroom in the classroom because they don't want to call attention for their physical thinking.
One in five is not attending class at all of the days when you don't feel comfortable about it.
And in the tests, if you don't think you see things good, specifically if you don't think you're fast enough, you get a little note to the average of your fellow who don't care about it as appearance.
And this phenomenon has been widespread in Finland, America and China, and China, and China, and China, and China, and China, and China, and China, and China, and China, and China, and China, and China, and China, and China, and China, and China, and China, and China, and China, and China, and China, and China, and China, and China, and China, and China, and China, and China, and China, and
And it turns out regardless of what these young people weigh from.
So, so that to be clear, we're talking about how you see you not about how you are really.
The low self-esteem over your body is <unk> the academic performance.
And it's also <unk> health.
<unk> with little self-esteem do less physical activity, they eat fewer fruit and vegetables, participate in more healthy diet that can take you to a food <unk>
They have low self-esteem.
They are more easily threatened by the people around and are in higher risk of depression.
And we think it's all about this for what they make more <unk> more than the consumption of alcohol and drugs, diet <unk> aesthetic surgery, aesthetic sexual partner to young ages and no harm harm.
The search for the perfect body is pushing to the health system, and our government costs billions of dollars every year.
And we're not <unk>
Women who believe you have a overweight again, regardless of whether or don't have higher rates of <unk>
17 percent of women don't present to a job interview in a day where they don't feel safe with the way you see.
Think for a moment in what this is doing to our economy.
If we could overcome this, what would that be like <unk>
<unk> this potential is a interest for each of us.
But how do we do that?
Well, talking about itself, it doesn't take you too far.
It's not enough.
If you really want to change things, you have to do something.
And we've learned that there are three key ways. The first is we need to instill trust in your own body.
We need to help our teens develop strategies to overcome the pressure of perfect images and build their self-esteem.
The good news is that there are a lot of programs available to do it.
The bad news is that most of these don't work.
I was very shocked when I learned that many <unk> programs without realizing it, <unk> the situation.
So, we need to make sure that the program that is still our children are not only going to have a positive impact, but also a lasting impact.
And research studies show that the best programs are focused on six key areas -- the first is the influence of family, friends and relationships.
These six aspects are critical points for anyone to provide an education in your body self-esteem that works.
One education is a fundamental one, but to deal with this problem requires each of us that let's take the reins in the issue, and we are a better model to follow for women and girls in our own lives.
challenging the current status of as women are seen and mentioned in our circles.
It's not good to have the contribution of our politicians in <unk> or the size of their <unk> or the size of their <unk> or <unk> that determination or the success of an Olympic athlete depends on the fact that it's not a great beauty.
We need to start judge the people for what they are, not as you see.
All of us can begin to do that by assuming the responsibility for the kind of images and comments that we published in our social networks.
We can engage people based on their effort and their actions and not in their appearance.
And let me ask you, when it was the last time that I had a <unk>
In short, we need to work together as communities, like governments and businesses, to really change our culture, for our children to grow up to their own person to grow the individuality, the diversity, the <unk>
We need to put people who are really making the difference in a <unk>
To make a difference in the real world, let's make them be the ones that come out on the big screen because we will just create a different world.
A world where our children are free to become the best version of themselves, where the way they believe you are never seeing the <unk> of being who they are, or to reach what they want in their lives.
Think of what this can mean for someone in their lives.
Who are in mind?
<unk>
<unk>
<unk>
<unk> A <unk>
It could be simply the woman who is at two seats. What would it mean for her if he was liberated from that <unk> voice in his interior, that I would love him for not to have long legs -- <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
What would it mean for her to do if we were able to do this, and we would measure it to the potential of that way?
Right now, the obsession of our culture with images is going on, all of us.
But let's go back to our children the truth.
<unk> that the way you see is just a part of your identity, and the truth is that we love them for those who are and what they do, and as they make us feel.
<unk> the self-esteem in the <unk> of our schools.
Let's change each of us, the way we're talking about, and we compare to other people.
And <unk> together as a community, from small groups to governments, so that the small <unk> of a year of age today, they become agents of insurance change in themselves tomorrow.
So let's do it.
On the five of November 11, 1990, a gentleman named <unk> <unk> walked into a hotel in Manhattan and killed the <unk> <unk> the leader of the League of Defense <unk>
At <unk> initially they were able to declared it, but I was imprisoned by other <unk> in the company of others, started planning attacks to about 12 icons of New York City, including <unk> <unk> and the United Nations.
Luckily, those plans <unk> by an FBI informant of the FBI.
Sadly, the bomb of 1993 in the World Trade Center, couldn't stop it.
Later on, he would be convicted of his participation in that <unk>
<unk> <unk> is my dad.
I was born in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, in 1983, being a <unk> engineer with a <unk> American mother, master school teacher -- among the two made everything possible for giving me a happy childhood
Only when I was seven years old, our family started to change.
My father taught me a way of Islam, that very few, even most Muslims get to know.
And I saw that when people take time to interact, it doesn't require a lot to want to want the same things in life.
However, in all religion, in all human group, there is always a small fraction of people who are <unk> so <unk> to their convictions that think that we need to use all of the possible media so that everybody lived like them.
A few months of the arrest he sat with me and explained that in the last weekends, he and explained that in the last weekends, he and some friends, had been going to shoot in Long Island to practice.
He said that I would go with him the next day.
We got to the <unk> <unk> which, without knowing our group, I was <unk> by the FBI.
When I got <unk> my father helped me hold the <unk> on the shoulder, and he explained how to aim at about 30 meters.
That day, with the last bullet I shot shot at the little light light on the target, and to surprise you, especially me, the whole goal broke on fire.
My uncle went to the other and Arabic, he said, <unk> <unk>
His father, such child.
In all, the comment has been a lot of laughter. But just a few years later, I understood what they were so funny.
Did you see in me, the same level of destruction that my father could <unk>
Those people later would be convicted of putting a stick with 700 pounds.
I admired those men.
He called them <unk> which means uncle.
When I turned 19, I had moved 20 times -- that instability during my childhood, I was not allowed to do a lot of <unk>
Every time I started to feel comfortable about someone was now time to pack and go to another city.
As I was always the new face of the class that was often a victim of <unk>
<unk> my identity to avoid being the white, but to be the new of the class, silent and <unk> age.
So most of the time was going on home reading books, watching TV or playing video games.
For these reasons I didn't develop social skills, to grow under <unk> I wasn't prepared for the real world.
I was <unk> opera to people, based on <unk> indicators like his race or their religion.
So how could I open the eyes?
One of the first experiences they put together my way of thinking, it was during the presidential election elections.
In a <unk> program, in which I was involved in the National Convention in Philadelphia.
My group was <unk> in the subject of juvenile violence, like I had been a victim of <unk> almost all my life, was something that I felt a lot of passion.
The members of this group came from different <unk>
One day, at the end of the <unk> I discovered that one of the kids who we had done, I was a Jewish woman.
It took several days to go out to the light this detail and realized that there was no <unk> between the two.
I had never had a Jewish friend and I really felt very proud to have been able to beat the barrier that all life had made me believe it was <unk>
Another crucial moment arose when I got a summer job in Bush -- <unk> a <unk> park.
I found myself with people all kinds of beliefs and cultures. That experience was fundamental in the development of my character.
All life had been taught to me that the <unk> was a sin and by extension, all the gay ones were bad <unk>
I happened to have a chance to work with gay actors there, in a show, and I could see many of them were the <unk> and less critics who had seen in life.
As a child, I developed a sense of empathy towards the suffering of the others -- but it was not easy to me to treat people, exactly the way I wish to be treated.
For that feeling I was able to contrast the stereotypes that they had taught me as a child, with the experience of interaction in real life.
I don't know how that is going to be homosexual but I know what it is to be paid by something beyond my control.
Then came the <unk> <unk>
Every night, Jon Stewart made me <unk> honest with my <unk> and he helped me see that race of people, religion or sexual orientation, you don't have anything to do with character.
In many ways, he became my figure <unk> at a time that I was desperately <unk>
And sometimes, the inspiration can come from the unexpected and a Jewish comedian would have had a better influence in my life that my own father, <unk> was not in vain.
One day I had a conversation with my mother about how I was changing my way to think, and she told me something to keep my heart forever, while he's alive.
She looked at me with the <unk> eyes of someone who has suffered enough with endless <unk> and he said, "I'm tired of <unk>
At that moment, I realized how much negative energy you need to keep all that hatred inside of your inside.
My real name is not <unk> <unk>
I changed it when my family decided to break the relationship with my father and started a new life.
So why did I go out and put myself in a possible risk?
Well, it's simple.
I've done this because I hope somebody who's going to try to get to the violence -- I can hear my story and understand that there's a better path. That even though I would join this ideology of violent ideology -- I didn't get to make me <unk>
On the contrary, I decided to use my experience to fight against terrorism and against prejudice.
I do it by the victims of terrorism and their loved loved pain and the loss that terrorism has produced them in their lives.
For the victims of terrorism to talk about those acts without meaning, like rejection to the actions of my father.
With this <unk> I'm showing you here as a proof that violence is not inherent to any religion or -- that the children don't have to follow the paths of their parents.
I'm not my dad.
Thank you.  Thank you all --  Thank you all.  Thank you.
At this point, there's a film that is projected in their minds.
It's an incredible film movie.
It's in 3D, and it has <unk> sound from what you hear and see right now. But that's just the beginning.
Your film has sound and flavor and texture.
It feels your body, your pain, your famine, your pleasure.
It has emotions, anger and happiness.
It has memories, as moments of your childhood that I project in front of your eyes.
And there's constantly a voice superimposed on your <unk> of conscious thinking.
The heart of the movie is you who experiences everything in place.
This film is your flow of consciousness, the subject of the experience of the mind and the world.
Consciousness is one of the fundamental truths of the human being.
Each of us is conscious.
We all have an internal film, you and you.
There is nothing to be more directly.
At least I know that I have a consciousness of it.
I have no certainty that you are aware of it.
Consciousness is also the reason to live.
If we were not aware of anything in our lives it would make sense or value.
But at the same time is the most mysterious phenomenon of the universe.
Why are we <unk>
Why do we have these films <unk>
Why are we not just robots that are going to be able to produce outcomes without experiencing the movie <unk>
Right now, nobody knows the answers to those questions.
I suggest that to integrate consciousness to science, you need some radical ideas.
Some people say it's impossible for a science of consciousness.
Science is objective by nature, it's objective to objective it.
<unk> for nature, is subjective people.
So there may never be a science of consciousness.
Because during almost the 20th century, <unk> that vision.
The psychology was studying the <unk> behavior -- the neuroscience is a <unk> brain, but never mentioned consciousness.
Even 30 years ago, when TED began, there were very few scientists on consciousness.
<unk> 20 years ago, everything started to change.
<unk> like Francis Crick and physicists like Roger <unk> said, <unk> is the moment for science to <unk> <unk>
And since then, there was a real bang, a <unk> of scientific work about consciousness.
And this work was fantastic. It was great.
But it also has fundamental limitations to the moment.
The center of the science of consciousness in recent years was the pursuit of <unk> correlations between some areas of the brain and some states of consciousness.
We saw some of this guy in the fantastic work that I introduced Nancy <unk> a few minutes ago.
We now understand a lot better, for example, the brain areas that are related to the conscious experience of faces or feeling pain or feeling happy.
But this is still a <unk> science.
It's not a science of explanations.
We know that these brain areas are related to certain types of conscious experience, but we don't know why.
I'd like to explain by saying that this kind of work of neuroscience is answering some questions that we want to explain to consciousness. The questions about what people are doing certain areas of the brain and what it is about.
But in a sense, those are the easy problems.
<unk> <unk>
There's actually no easy problems with consciousness.
Well, it doesn't address the real mystery of this <unk> Why all the physical process in the brain has to be accompanied by consciousness?
Why is there an internal <unk> movie.
Right now, we can't understand it.
And you can say, let's give a few years to the neuroscience.
It's going to turn into another emerging phenomenon like <unk> like <unk> like life, and we're going to find explanation.
The typical <unk> are all cases of emerging behaviors, how they operate <unk> how they work <unk> how they're adapted and adapt to their living organisms -- they are all questions about the target work.
That could be applied to the human brain to explain some behaviors and the functions of the human brain -- how we speak, how we speak, how we speak, how we speak, how we speak <unk> all of them are questions about behavior.
But when it comes to consciousness, the questions about behavior are among easy problems.
But the hard problem, is the question of why it is that all behavior is accompanied with a <unk> experience.
And here it is, the standard paradigm of <unk> the standard paradigm of neuroscience, actually doesn't have a lot to say.
I'm a <unk> <unk>
I want a scientific theory of <unk> that would work for a long time, hit me on the head against the wall for a theory of consciousness in terms of consciousness that would work.
But at the end, I got to the conclusion that that didn't work for <unk> reasons.
I think we're going to get rid of this point.
We have a chain of wonderful explanation, great. We get used to this, the physics explains chemistry, chemistry explains biology, biology explains a part of psychology.
But consciousness doesn't seem to fit into this scheme.
On the one hand, it's a fact that we're conscious.
We don't know how to accommodate that idea to our scientific vision of the world.
I think consciousness, right now, it's kind of a <unk> something that we need to integrate to our view of the world, but we don't know even how.
With an anomaly like this, you can need radical ideas, I think we need ideas that at the beginning of <unk> crazy before we can deal with consciousness in a scientific way.
There's some possibilities for these crazy ideas.
My friend Dan Dennett, who's here today, has one.
His crazy idea is that there is no such a difficult problem of consciousness.
All the idea of the real subjective film includes a kind of illusion or confusion.
In fact, what you need to do, is to explain the functions of the brain behaviors -- the behaviors of the brain, and it studies everything that needs explanation.
Well, more power for him.
That's the kind of radical idea that we need to explore if we want to have a theory of purely purely <unk> <unk>
At the same time, for me and for many others, that vision is quite close to simply deny that the observation of consciousness is satisfying to it.
But I'm in a different direction.
In the time, I want to explore two crazy ideas that I think can be <unk>
The first crazy idea is that consciousness is critical.
physicists sometimes take some aspects of the universe as <unk> <unk> space, space, time and mass.
<unk> fundamental laws that <unk> like the laws of gravity or quantum mechanics.
These laws and fundamental properties don't explain in terms of any more basic terms.
On the contrary, they consider principles, and in there it builds up the world.
Sometimes, the list of the fundamental is <unk>
In the 19th century, <unk> discovered that you can't explain the electric phenomena in terms of fundamental concepts -- space, time, mass, mass law, and so I applied the basic laws of the <unk> and I applied the electric charge as a fundamental concept that those laws are <unk>
I think that's the situation that we find with consciousness.
If you can't explain consciousness in terms of fundamental ideas that are <unk> space, time, mass mass, then by a matter of logic, you have to add the list.
The most natural thing would be <unk> consciousness itself as a fundamental brick of nature.
This doesn't mean that suddenly it's not the object of science.
It opens up the way to <unk> scientifically.
So what we need is to study the fundamental laws that govern consciousness, the laws that connect consciousness with other fundamental concepts the space, the weather, <unk> processes.
The physicists sometimes say we want the fundamental laws that we want to do it in a <unk>
The situation of consciousness is something like this.
We want to find fundamental laws so simple that we can get them in a t-shirt.
We don't know what laws are, but that's what we're looking for.
The second crazy idea is that consciousness can be universal.
Each system can have a degree of consciousness.
This vision is sometimes called <unk> <unk> by all of us, <unk> -- every system is aware, not only humans, dogs, dogs, mice, or flies, even the microbes from Rob <unk> the elementary particles.
Even a <unk> has some degree of consciousness.
The idea is not that photons are smart or <unk>
It's not that a <unk> can be full of heartbreak when you think <unk> always traveling the speed of light.
I can never slow down and smell the <unk>
No, it's not.
But the thought is that perhaps photons can have some element of crude feeling that we have a primitive precursor to consciousness.
This may sound a little crazy for you.
How do you think about something so <unk>
Part of this comes from the first crazy idea, that consciousness is a fundamental thing.
If it's fundamental -- like space, the time and the mass, is natural to assume that it can also be universal, just like others.
It's also worth noticing that even though the idea seems to us, it's much less for people in different cultures, where the human mind seems more a continuous with nature.
A deeper reason comes from the idea that perhaps the simplest and powerful way of finding fundamental laws that <unk> thinking with the physical process, is <unk> consciousness with information.
Whenever there are information processing, there are awareness.
<unk> of complex <unk> like in a human being, rather complex.
<unk> of simple, simple information, simple.
Something really exciting is that in recent years, a neuroscientist, <unk> <unk> took this kind of theory and I developed it <unk> with mathematicians.
It has a mathematical measure of information integration of information, which is called <unk> which measures the degree of information integrated into a system.
And I'm supposed to be able to do with consciousness.
So in a human brain, there's an incredible degree of information, of information, a high degree of <unk> a lot of consciousness.
In a mouse there is a degree of integration integration of information, as well as significant -- rather important awareness.
But when you get to the worms, microbes, particles, the degree of <unk> <unk>
The level of integration of information is small, but it's not zero either.
In <unk> theory, there will still be a level of consciousness different from zero.
In fact a fundamental law of <unk> <unk> high degree of consciousness.
In addition, another reason is that <unk> can help us integrate consciousness to the physical world.
<unk> and philosophers are often observed that physics is curiously abstract.
It describes the structure of reality using a lot of equations, but we don't talk about the reality behind the rain behind us.
As Stephen Hawking, "Where does the fire come from?
From <unk> the equations of physics can be given as they are, but you can use to describe the flow of consciousness.
That's what physicists do basically describe the flow of consciousness.
According to this vision, the consciousness is the one that puts fire in the equations.
In that vision, consciousness is not about the physical world as a kind of <unk>
It's right there in the center.
This vision -- I think, <unk> vision has the potential to <unk> our relationship to nature, and it can have social and ethical and ethical consequences.
Some can be <unk>
I used to think that I shouldn't eat anything that would have consciousness, then I should be a <unk>
If you're a <unk> and you take that vision, you'll have a lot of hungry.
I think that thinking good, this tends to transform your <unk> while what matters in ethical terms, and moral <unk> is not so much the fact that the fact of consciousness, but its importance and its complexity.
It's also natural to ask for consciousness in other systems, like computers.
What about the artificial intelligence system of Samantha <unk>
It's <unk>
According to the vision of information <unk> she has an integrated information processing -- so the answer is yes, if it's conscious.
If this is right, you have a fairly serious ethical problem about the ethic of the development of smart computers and the ethics of <unk>
Finally, you can ask for consciousness of collective collective -- the planet.
Canada has their own consciousness?
Or a local level, an integrated level, as the audience in a TED Talk, we have a TED consciousness -- at this time we have a TED consciousness -- an inner film for this entire TED group, different from the internal movies on each of the <unk>
I don't know the answer to that question, but I think at least it's a question that needs to be serious.
So this <unk> <unk> is a radical vision, and I don't know if it's right.
I'm actually safer in the first crazy idea, which consciousness is a fundamental thing, which is a fundamental thing to be universal.
The vision raises a lot of questions, many challenges, like, how those bits of thinking contribute to the kind of complex awareness that we know and love it.
If we can answer those questions, then I think we're going on the right path towards a theory of serious awareness.
If not, well, it's probably the most difficult problem for science and philosophy.
We can't wait to solve it at night in the morning.
But I think we're finally going to be able to find it.
Understanding consciousness is the real key, I think, to understand the universe and to understand ourselves.
Maybe we just need the crazy idea.
Thank you.
I grew up in a small rural village in Victoria.
He had a very normal, <unk> profile.
I went to school, I was fascinated with my friends, and I was scared with my younger sisters.
It was all very normal.
And when I was 15, a member of my community came up to my parents because I wanted to <unk> for a community prize.
And my parents said, "Well, that's very nice, but there is a problem right.
She doesn't really get anything."  And they were right.
I went to school, I had good grades. After school, I had a <unk> profile in the <unk> of my mother, and I spent a lot of time looking at the <unk> and the <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk>
Yes, I know. What contradiction.
But they were right.
I did nothing that was extraordinary at all.
Nothing that can be considered as a achievement if we take the disability out of the equation.
Years later, being in the second part of teaching in a high school school in <unk> just after about 20 minutes in the middle class, and a guy raised his hand and said, "Hey, when to your <unk>
And I said, "What would you say?
Well, I had been talking about the <unk> law for good 20 minutes.
And he said, "You know, your <unk> speech.
When people on wheelchair, they talk about things that are <unk> in school?"
She said, "Well, in the classroom.
And it was then when I realized, this kid had had experiences with disabled people like inspiration.
And we are not. And it's not the question of the boy, I mean, that's true for many of us.
For us, people with disability are not our teachers or our doctors or our <unk>
We are not real people. We're there to inspire.
And in fact, I'm on this stage, which is what I do in this chair, and you're probably waiting for you. Right?
Well, ladies and gentlemen, I'm afraid by <unk> <unk>
I'm not here to <unk>
I'm here to tell you that we were lied to disability.
Yes, they have been sold the lie that disability is something <unk> A <unk> <unk>
It's a bad thing and living with a disability makes you <unk>
It's not something wrong and it doesn't make you <unk>
And in the last few years, we've been able to spread even more this lie through social media.
You may have seen images like this: "The only disability in life is a bad <unk>
Or this <unk> "Your excuse is <unk>
Or this <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
These are just a couple of examples, but there's a huge amount of them.
It may be that you've seen one of the girl with no hand drawing with a pen held by the mouth.
You may have seen a child running with <unk> fiber legs.
And there's a bunch of these images, that are what we call <unk> <unk>
And I use the term porn -- because we were going to give a group of people for the benefit of another group of people.
So in this case, <unk> the disabled people with no disability.
The purpose of these images is <unk> <unk> so that we can see them and think, "Well, because it's very bad that it's my life, it could be worse.
I could be that boy.
But if you're that person?
I've lost account the number of times that I've been talking about strange <unk> to express that they believe that I am brave or a source of inspiration, and this was going to happen before my work had a public profile.
It was as if I was scared for the morning and remember my own name.  And this is <unk>
These images, those images attached to people with disabled people in the benefit of people without disability.
They're there for you to see you and think that things aren't so bad for you, or to put their concerns in perspective.
And life as a disabled person is actually a difficult thing.
<unk> some things.
But the things that we overcome is not the things that you can think of.
They're not relative to our bodies.
I use the term <unk> <unk> deliberately because I was reminded of the so-called social model of disability, that tells us that we are more disabled because of the society that we live in, because of our bodies or diagnosis.
So I've lived in this body for a long time.
I'm very <unk> with him.
So the things I need to do, and I've learned to get the best of their ability as well as you do, and that's what happens to the children of those pictures as well.
They're not doing anything out of the commons.
They are simply using their bodies getting the best of their ability.
So it's actually just <unk> in the way we do that, by sharing those <unk>
When people say, "You're a source of <unk> it says it as a compliment.
And I know why it happens.
It's because of the lie, because they have been sold this lie that disability makes us quite remarkable.
And honestly, it doesn't do it.
And I know what you're thinking.
I'm here <unk> the inspiration and you think, "My God, you're not sometimes inspired by anything?"
And I actually know I am.
<unk> of other people with disability at all time.
But I don't know that I'm more lucky than them.
<unk> that this is a great idea to use <unk> <unk> to collect the things that they fall over.  <unk> the clever trick of how you can charge your mobile phone on your chair.
Great.
We learn from the force and resistance of others, not against our bodies and our <unk> but a world that <unk> and <unk>
I really think that that lie that has been sold about disability is the biggest <unk>
It makes us hard life.
And that quote: "The only disability in life is a bad <unk> the reason that that's lie is because it's not true -- because of the social model of disability.
A lot of smiles in front of the stairs has never made it become a <unk>
Never.   <unk> on a TV screen will not come up with the <unk> for people who are <unk>
Nor are a lot of people in the middle of a bookstore in the middle of a bookstore and <unk> a positive attitude to turn all those books into the <unk>
It's just not going to happen.
I really want to live in a world where disability is not the exception, but the norm.
I want to live where a 10-year-old girl sitting in his bedroom watching <unk> the <unk> <unk> doesn't be considered <unk> of anything because of being in a chair.
I want to live in a world where we don't have so low expectations of the people with disability that we are <unk> to get away from the bed and remember our names in the morning.
I want to live in a world where we value the genuine achievement of people with disabilities, and I want to live in a world where a child in 11 grade is not a little surprised that his new teacher is a wheelchair.
<unk> does not make us <unk> but question what you think to know about knowing about it.
Thank you.
What do you have to see <unk> <unk> and professional football with <unk>
And what is the average speed of a <unk> without <unk>
Unfortunately, today I just answer one of those questions, so please, not <unk>
When people think about <unk> they think about <unk> <unk> and Tom <unk> <unk> the hands in the air, but augmented reality is not science fiction.
<unk> reality is something that will happen in our days and will happen because we have the tools for it, and people need to learn, because reality reality will change our lives as much as the Internet and mobile phones.
So, how did we get to the <unk>
The first step, is what I'm wearing <unk> Google <unk>
I'm sure a lot of people are familiar with them.
What you may not know is that Google <unk> are a device that lets you see what I see.
It will allow you to experience what's going to be a professional <unk> in the field.
Right now, the only way to be in the field is that I tried to get <unk>
I have to use words.
I have to create a framework that you can do with your imagination.
We can use Google Glass, under a helmet and know what is running through the game of the game of the game of the game to 160 <unk> the blood hitting your ears.
We can know it feels like a man of 110 pounds <unk> <unk> trying to deal with all of your self.
I've been there and I assure you, it's not nice.
You know, some videos to show you what is to use Google <unk> under the helmet, and give you a sense of that.
Unfortunately, they are not images of the practice of <unk> because the idea of the emerging technology <unk> is an submarine up to the surface -- but we do what we can.
So let's look at a video.
Chris <unk> Come on.
It's horrible to be <unk>
A moment -- <unk> a little bit.
<unk>
Go!
Chris <unk> As you can see, it's a <unk> of what is going to be <unk> in the football field from the <unk> perspective.
You may have noticed that lack of people, the rest of the team.
We have a video of them, <unk> from the University of Washington.
<unk> mice. Mice <unk> mice.
Blue eight, Blue <unk> Go!
Chris <unk> This is a little bit more like a sense to be in the field -- but nothing to do with being in the <unk>
<unk> want that experience.
<unk> want to be in the field, being your favorite players -- and they have asked me on YouTube and <unk> you can see from the angle of a field <unk>
or a <unk>
We want to experience that."
Once we have that experience with <unk> and Google Glass, how do we go from <unk> how we took it to the next <unk>
We took it to that level using something called <unk> <unk> which surely many of you know it.
The Rift <unk> has been described as the most realistic virtual reality device ever created, and it's not cheap.
And I'm going to show you why, by why, with this video.
Man: Oh, Oh.
No, no, no, no, no, I don't want to keep <unk> No!
Oh, my God, Oh, my God! Ah!
<unk> That is the experience of a man on a Russian mountain, <unk> for his life.
What is the experience of a fan when you take a video of Adrian <unk> across the line, <unk> from a <unk> with the arm before they run and make a <unk> What is the experience of a fan
When it could be <unk> running through the <unk> throwing the ball into the background, or <unk> <unk> by doing a <unk>
What is your experience when you go from a mountain to more than 100 miles an hour like a <unk> <unk>
Maybe it's <unk> <unk> <unk>
But this is not still <unk>
It's just virtual reality.
How do we achieve the reality of <unk> <unk>
<unk> reality <unk> when <unk> and the owners see the information that people want to see and think, "How do we use this to improve our <unk>
How do we use it to win <unk>
Because they always use technology to gain.
They like to win. It gives you money.
So, here is a brief survey on technology in <unk>
In 1965, the <unk> of Baltimore put a <unk> to his field <unk> to play faster.
They won the Super Bowl that year.
Some teams decided to <unk>
More people saw the party because it was more exciting, faster.
In 1994, the <unk> put radios on the <unk> of the field <unk> and then in the <unk>
They had more viewers because it was faster, more fun.
In <unk> imagine that they're a player coming back to his group and you see his next accident shown in front of you, in a plastic bombsight that they carry on it, you don't have to worry about forget a <unk>
or to memorize the strategy.
Just go into the field and <unk>
And the coaches want it because if they don't follow their instructions, they lose parties, and they hate to lose <unk>
If you lose games like a coach.
They don't want that.
But augmented reality is not just a <unk> <unk>
<unk> reality is also a way to collect information and use it in real time to improve your way of playing the game.
How do you do?
Well, one very simple option would be to have a camera in every corner of the stadium having a view from the top of the people that's down.
You also get information from the <unk> and <unk> something that is already working on.
And all that information is sent to your <unk>
The good teams will know <unk>
The bad things will have information <unk>
This is going to give the good teams of bad guys.
So your computer team will be as important as your <unk> and data analysis will stop being just for nerds.
It will be also for <unk> Who would have <unk>
How would it be in the <unk>
Imagine that it's the field <unk>
It was the ball and <unk>
<unk> a open receptor. Suddenly, a <unk> on the left part of your bombsight will tell you that a defense behind you is going to <unk> usually <unk> but the <unk> system will kill you.
It <unk> to the protection.
Another <unk> <unk> you have an open receptor.
<unk> the <unk> but they <unk>
And the ball loses the trajectory.
You don't know where you land, however, the receptor sees in its bombsight an area of grass that lights up and you can modify the race.
It takes <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk>
The public <unk> and fans have been followed by each angle.
This is something that will create massive emotion in the game.
I'm going to make lots of people see it, because people want to live that experience.
<unk> want to be in the ground.
Do you want to be your favorite player.
<unk> reality will be part of sports because it's too profitable to not be.
But what I ask you is, we want this to be the only use of <unk> reality.
We're going to use it just as bread and <unk> like our <unk> entertainment.
Because I think we can use it for something else.
I think we can use augmented reality to foster the empathy between human beings, to show someone how it is literally going to be in the other person's place.
We know what this technology is worth <unk>
It generates billions of dollars a year.
But how much is this technology worth a professor in the classroom trying to show a <unk> how bad their actions are from the perspective of <unk>
How much is this technology worth a gay in Uganda or Russia trying to show the world how it lives to be <unk>
How much is it worth a <unk> <unk> or Neil <unk> <unk> trying to inspire a generation of children to think more in space and science instead of <unk> and <unk> notes.
Ladies and gentlemen, the augmented reality is coming.
The questions we do, the decisions we do and the challenges that we face, <unk> as the always, of us.
Thank you.
I recently gave myself after 23 years of service in the <unk> <unk> in California.
Most of those 23 years ago I spent the southern end of the County <unk> which includes the Golden Gate Bridge that includes the Golden Gate
The bridge is a <unk> structure, which is known by its beautiful view of San Francisco, the Pacific Ocean.
Unfortunately, it's a magnet for suicide, to be one of the most used places in the world.
The Golden Gate Bridge was opened in <unk>
Joseph <unk> engineer head of building the bridge, said that, "The bridge is pretty much for <unk>
<unk> from the bridge is not practical and <unk>
But from its openness, over 1,600 people have jumped to their death from that bridge.
Some people believe that traveling between the two towers will bring it to another dimension, this bridge has been <unk> as a matter of his, that each of them frees you out of all your concerns and pain, and the waters that go under <unk> your soul.
But let me tell you that happens when the bridge is used to commit suicide.
After a <unk> every four to five seconds, the body hits the water about 120 miles an hour.
The impact breaks down, some of which would have vital organs.
Most of them die in impact.
The ones that not, normally they <unk> in the <unk> water, and then they <unk>
I don't think that this is a suicide approach to realize the <unk> of death that will be <unk>
This is the wire.
Except about the two towers, there's 32 inches of parallel parallel to the bridge.
This is where most people are in order to get their life.
I can tell you about experience that once the person is on that edge, and at its dark time, it's very hard to bring it back.
I took this picture last year while this young man talked to an officer watching his life.
I want to tell you with joy that we had a successful day that day on her back to the <unk>
When I started working on the bridge, we had no formal training.
<unk> to channel the way through these calls.
This was not just a bad service for those of you who are <unk> but the officials are too.
We've come a long way since then.
Today, veterans and psychologists train the new official people.
This is Jason <unk>
I met him 22 <unk> last year when I got a call from a possible suicide company sitting in the fence near the center.
<unk> and when I got there, I looked to Jason talking with a bridge of the Golden Gate officer.
Jason had only 32 years old, and he had flown up here from New Jersey.
In fact, it had flown up to this two times from New Jersey to try to kill him from this bridge.
After about an hour talking to <unk> I asked ourselves if we knew the story of the box of <unk>
<unk> the mythology <unk> <unk> <unk> created <unk> and sent it to the Earth with a box, and he said, <unk> never open that <unk>
Well, one day, curiosity could more than <unk> and she opened the box.
She came out of her <unk> <unk> and all kinds of <unk> against the man.
The only thing in the box was hope.
So Jason asked us, "What if you open the box and there's no <unk>
He stopped a few <unk> leaned on the right, and it was.
This kind of smart guy in New Jersey had just taken your life.
I talked to the parents of Jason that night, and I guess when I was talking to them, he didn't seem to be ringing very well, because the next day, the family rabbi called me to see how it was.
The parents of Jason would have been <unk>
<unk> damage to suicide affects a lot of people.
I ask these questions: What would you do if a member of your family, a friend or someone loved <unk>
What would you do?
<unk> what to say?
In my experience, it's not just to talk, but you have to hear it.
Listening to understand.
Not <unk> <unk> or say to the person you know how it feels because they probably don't know.
Just being there, you can be the inflection point that they need.
If you think that someone is <unk> you're not afraid of <unk> and ask the question.
One way to ask you the question is, is it <unk> in similar circumstances have thought to end your life, you've had these <unk>
It would take the person in front of it can save the life and be the inflection point for them.
Other signs at <unk> despair, believe that things are terrible, and they will never be going to <unk> <unk> believe that there's nothing you can do with <unk> social isolation, and a lost interest in life.
I came up with this talk just a couple of days, and I got an email from a lady and I'd like to read you his letter.
She lost his son on the 19 of January, this year, and he wrote this email just a couple of days ago, and it's with her permission and I read it.
"Hello, <unk> I guess you're at the TED conference.
It must be a whole experience being there.
I'm thinking that it should go to the bridge this weekend.
I just wanted to leave you a note.
I hope you can tell a lot of people and go home talking about it to your friends who tell your friends, etc.
I'm still quite <unk> but noticing more moments of me to realize that Mike didn't go home.
Mike was driving <unk> to San Francisco to see the <unk> party with his father the 19 of January.
Never got there.
I called the police police police and <unk> it as disappeared that night.
The next morning, two officials came to my house and reported that the car of Mike was down in the bridge.
A witness I had seen him jump from the bridge to the <unk> on the evening of the day.
Thank you very much for fighting for those who can be temporarily too weak to fight for themselves.
Who hasn't been wrong before without suffering a real mental illness.
It shouldn't be so easy to end up with it.
My prayers are with you for your fight.
The Golden Gate Bridge is supposed to be a passage through our beautiful <unk> not a <unk>
Good luck this week, <unk>
I can't imagine the value that she needed to go to the bridge and walk the way his son took that day, and also the value to go forward.
I'd like to introduce you to a man that I mean with hope and value.
The 11th of March of 2005, I wrote to a radio call for a potential bomber for a possible bomber of the northern bridge near the north.
I was able to get my landed on the sidewalk and looked at this man, Kevin <unk> foot on the sidewalk.
When he saw me, he crossed the <unk> and stopped in that little tube that goes around the tower.
During the hour and a half later, I heard like Kevin talked about his depression and <unk>
Kevin decided for his account day to go back to that lane and give life another opportunity.
When Kevin turned out the <unk>
"This is a new beginning, a new life."
But I asked him, "What was it that he did that <unk> and gave him to hope and life <unk>
And you know what told me?
He said, "I <unk>
You stopped talking and just <unk>
Shortly after that incident, I got a letter from the mother of Kevin, and I have this letter with me, and I would like to <unk>
"Dear Mr. <unk> nothing erase the <unk> events and you're one of the reasons why Kevin is still with us.
Honestly, I think Kevin was <unk> for help.
It's been diagnosed with a mental illness for which it has been properly <unk>
And then Kevin when I only had six months -- completely unconscious of all of those traits -- but thank God, now we know.
Kevin is in order, like it says.
So thank God for you.
I didn't spend debt with you, <unk> <unk>
And at the end, she writes <unk> when I visited the General <unk> Hospital that night, you would go through as the patient.
<unk> I had to do it <unk>
Today, Kevin is a <unk> father.
It talks openly about the events of that day and his depression with the hope that his story will inspire others.
<unk> is not just something that I've found myself at work.
It's personal.
My grandfather had a poison.
That act, despite finishing their own pain, theft.
This is what suicide.
For most people -- or those who consider suicide would not think they hurt another person.
They just want your own pain <unk>
Usually this is only about three things: sleep, drugs or alcohol or death.
In my career, I said, and I've been involved in hundreds of mental illnesses and calls around the bridge.
From those incidents that I've been directly involved, I've only lost two, but those two are too much.
One was <unk>
The other one was a man who talked about about an hour.
During that time, I would get my hand at three times.
On the end, I looked at me, and he said, "I'm sorry, I'm sorry, but I have to go."
And <unk>
<unk> absolutely awful.
I want to tell you, though, that the vast majority of the people that we get to contact in that bridge is not <unk>
In addition, those few who have jumped from the bridge and lived in and that can talk about it, that one or two, most of those people have said that the second one who leaves side that the railing realized that they had made a mistake and they wanted to live.
I tell people, the bridge is not only connected to <unk> with San Francisco, but also people.
That connection, or the bridge that we do, is something that everyone and every one of us must be able to be used to do.
suicide can prevent.
There is help. There's hope.
Thank you very much.
The world makes you be what you're not from, but inside you know what you are, and a question <unk> How do you feel like that?
I have to be a single thing in that sense, but I'm not alone that I'm not alone.
When I became a model I felt that I had finally achieved the dream that I had had since a child.
My outside finally <unk> my inner journey, with my inner self.
For reasons reasons, the ones that I'm going to happen later, when I look at this picture, I'm thinking, you got it, <unk> it <unk>
But last October, I discovered that, <unk> I'm beginning.
We all shook our families, our religion, our society, our society in history, even our bodies.
Some of them have the value of <unk> to get rid of the limitations of the skin of the skin or the beliefs of those around us.
They are people who always defy the status quo, which is considered <unk>
In my case, the last nine years, many of my neighbors, many of my friends, my agent even ignored my story.
I think this mystery is called <unk>
This is mine.
I recorded as <unk> when I was born because of the appearance of my <unk>
I remember my five years in the Philippines, in my home, I was always wearing this t-shirt on the head.
And my mom asked me, "Why don't you always take that t-shirt in the <unk>
I said, "Mom, it's my hair -- I'm a <unk>
I knew how to <unk>
The gender is always considered a <unk> but now we know that, really, it's a more complex and mystery <unk>
Because of my success, I will never tell you about sharing my story, not because thought that I'm going to be a bad person, but how the world is dealing with those of us who want to <unk>
Every day I appreciate being a woman.
I have mom and a family who accept me as I am.
Many are not so lucky.
There's a long tradition in the Asian culture that celebrates the mystery of gender.
There's a Buddhist goddess of compassion.
There's a goddess <unk> goddess of <unk>
And when I was eight years old, I was at a party in the Philippines that celebrated these puzzles.
I was in front of the stage and I remember that this beautiful woman came in front of me, and I remember that moment as if something happened to me. This is the kind of woman I wanted to be.
And when I was 15, when I was 15, I met this woman named <unk>
It's the CEO of a <unk> beauty competition.
That night, she asked me, "Why haven't you ever participated in the <unk> competition.
He told me that if he <unk> she was going to get away from the <unk> of <unk> and starving, and that night, I won in bathroom, and I was looking at <unk> and I was looking at the third one of over 40 candidate candidates.
That moment changed my life.
Suddenly, I was inside the world of beauty.
Not a lot of people may say that their first job was the queen of beauty of women, but I can.
I also met the goddess of <unk> especially when they were to remote provinces of the Philippines.
But more importantly, I met my best friends in that community.
In 2001, my mother, who had moved to San Francisco, I was called, and I told me that he passed my head of the green card that I could go to live in the U.S.
I was shocked.
I told my mother, "Mommy, I'm <unk>
I'm here with friends, I like to travel and be a queen of <unk>
But then, two weeks later, I called me and said, "You know what, if you get to the United States, you can change the name and the identity of <unk>
It was all I needed to hear.
My mom suggested I put two <unk> to my name.
And she also accompanied me when I was born in Thailand to 19 years.
It's curious that in some of the most rural cities in Thailand do the most secure surgeries and safe surgeries and secure.
In that time, in the United States, it was necessary to get surgery before they changed the name and gender.
So in 2001 I went to San Francisco, and I remember looking at the driver license with the name of the name of the name of gender and <unk>
It was a great moment.
For some people, their identity document means power to drive or be able to get a <unk> but for me it was the license to live, to feel <unk>
Suddenly my fears saw <unk>
I felt I could conquer my dream and move to New York, and to be model.
Many are not so lucky.
I think of this woman of <unk> <unk> <unk>
A young woman in New York who was <unk> he lived his truth, but <unk> put his life.
For many of my community, that's the reality that they live.
Our suicide rates are eight times higher than the rest of the population.
All the 20 of November is doing a global waking percent of the <unk> Day.
I'm on this stage because of a long story of people who <unk> and stood up to injustice.
These are Marsha P. Johnson and Sylvia <unk>
Today, at this same moment, I'm coming out of the closet.
I can't continue to live my truth and just me.
I want to do the best to help others live their truth without shame, or fear.
I'm here, <unk> so that someday there is no longer <unk> from 20 <unk>
My deepest truth took me to accept what I am.
Do you?
Thank you very much.
Thank you, thank you, thank you.  <unk> <unk> <unk> a quick question.
<unk> <unk> Sure. So first, thank you with all my <unk>
To my support network, my parents especially, was to my family, which is very strong.
I remember all the times that I've been to young women who have been <unk> who have <unk> and some times, when they were called me and told me that their parents couldn't accept it, I would call my mom and said, "Mommy, can you call this <unk>
Sometimes it worked, other no. It's just gender identity, that's what's in the center of what we are, right?
I mean, all of us was assigned to each other at birth, and what I try to do is to put on the table that I try to do is put on the table -- that I should have a space that would allow people to <unk> and this is a conversation that we should have with parents, with colleagues.
The <unk> movement is <unk> compared to the gay movement.
There's still a lot of work to do.
There should be understanding.
There should be space for curiosity and to ask questions, and I hope that all of you are my allies.
KS: All right. <unk> Thank you.
In many <unk> and tribal societies, the parents are usually known for their children, but I'm one of the few parents who is known to you about her daughter and I'm proud of it.
<unk> started his campaign for education defending their rights in 2007. And when their efforts was thrown in 2011, to the <unk> the <unk> National Prize <unk> became very popular a young girl in his country.
Before that, I was my daughter, but now I'm his dad.
Ladies and gentlemen, if you take a look at the history of mankind, the story of women is the story of the <unk> of violence and the exploitation.
You see, in <unk> societies right from the beginning, when they were born, a little girl, their birth is not <unk>
It was not welcome to her father, or for her mother.
The neighborhood comes around, gives her <unk> to mother and nobody <unk> the father.
And a mother came up very much for having a child.
When it gives birth to the first child, the first daughter, it gets sad.
When it gives birth to the second daughter, <unk> and with the hope of a son, when he <unk> his third daughter, he feels guilty like a criminal.
Not just the cancer mother -- but the daughter, <unk> daughter, <unk> when it grows, it's too.
At age five years, when I should go to school, it was left home and the school pays to their siblings.
Until the age of 12 years old, it has a good life.
You can <unk>
You can play with your friends on the street, and it can move through the streets like a butterfly.
But when it comes into adolescence, when it was 13 years old, he gets sick to go out of her house without a male <unk>
It's confined to the four walls of their house.
It's no longer a free person.
It becomes the so-called honor of his father and her brothers and his family, and if you <unk> the code of that -- honor, the could even kill.
And it's interesting that this assumption of honor, not only affects the life of a <unk> it also affects the life of male members of the family.
So this brother <unk> the joys of his life and the happiness of his sisters on the name of the honor.
And there's a norm of the <unk> societies.
A good girl is supposed to be very <unk> very humble and very <unk>
It's the judgment.
The model of a good girl must be <unk>
It's supposed to be silent and accepts the decisions of their father and their mother and the decisions of the elderly even if they didn't want it.
If you put it with a man who doesn't like or if you <unk> it with an old man, it has to be <unk> because it doesn't want to be <unk> <unk>
If the very young one, you have to accept it.
Otherwise, <unk> <unk>
And what happens to the end?
In the words of a <unk> "The <unk> and then gives birth to more children and <unk>
And the irony of the situation is that this mother, <unk> the same lesson from <unk> to his daughter and the same lesson for their children.
And this vicious cycle continues and continues.
<unk> brothers and sisters, when I was born <unk> and for the first time, believe me, I don't like newborns, to be honest, but when I was there, and I looked at her eyes, trust me, extremely <unk>
And so much before I <unk> I thought about his name, and I was fascinated with a <unk> <unk> of freedom in Afghanistan.
His name was <unk> of <unk> and I called my daughter as well for her.
But when I was <unk> they were all men, and I grabbed my feather, and <unk> a line of my name, and I wrote, <unk>
And when she carried it on, when she was four and a half and a half years old, I read it in my school.
Can you be wondering why I have to mention a little girl in a school?
Yes, I have to <unk>
You can give it for granted in Canada, in the United States, in many developed countries, but in the poor countries, in tribal societies, in tribal societies, it's a big event for the life of a child.
<unk> in a school means the recognition of his identity and his name.
One route to school means it's in the world of dreams and aspirations where it can explore their potential for your future life.
I have five sisters, and none of them could go to school, and they would be <unk> two weeks earlier, when I went to the form of a <unk> Canada, and I was in the relative to the family, I couldn't remember the <unk> of some of my sisters.
And the reason I had never seen the names of my sisters written in any document.
That was the reason that value of my daughter.
What my father couldn't give my sisters and his daughters, I thought I had to change it.
I used to appreciate the intelligence and the <unk> of my daughter.
<unk> to sit with me when my friends came to me.
The encouraged to go with me to different meetings.
And all of these values, I've tried to figure it out in their personality.
And this was not just for her, just to <unk>
I have <unk> all these good values in my school to girls and boys in the same way.
I used education for <unk>
<unk> my daughters, taught students to forget the lesson of the <unk>
He taught them to forget the lesson from the so-called <unk>
<unk> brothers and sisters, <unk> for more rights for women, and <unk> to have more and more space for women in society.
But we find a new phenomenon.
It was a lethal for human rights and, in particular, for women's rights.
He was called <unk>
That means a complete denial of men's participation in all political and social activities.
Hundreds of schools were lost.
The girls banned them to go to school.
Women were forced to use <unk> and they stopped going to markets.
The musicians were <unk> the girls <unk> and the singers were killed.
<unk> millions, but a few <unk> and it was terrifying to have around those people who kill and <unk> when you talk about their rights.
It's really frightening.
At the age of 10 years old, <unk> got up and raised out of the right to education.
He wrote a newspaper for the BBC, of the BBC, he was offered her same for the documentaries of the New York Times, and I talked about every platform that could.
And his voice was the most powerful voice.
They were <unk> as a <unk> around the world.
And that was the reason that the Taliban could not tolerate his campaign and the <unk> in October 2012, was shot in the head.
It was a day <unk> for my family and me.
The world became a big black hole.
Whereas my daughter was <unk> between life and death, and I would read to the ear of my wife -- "I've got <unk> for what happened to my daughter, <unk>
And <unk> said to me, "Please, don't give you <unk>
<unk> the fair cause.
<unk> your life in play because of the truth of the truth, because of the peace of peace, and because of education, and your daughter inspired you and you get stuck.
Both were on the right path and God <unk>
These very few words <unk> a lot to me, and I didn't go back to ask again.
When <unk> was in the hospital and had headaches and severe headaches and strong headaches because his facial nerve was cut down, I used to see a dark shadow that was <unk> by the face of my wife.
But my daughter was never <unk>
I used to <unk> I'm okay with my smile <unk> and with the <unk> on my face.
I'm going to give you good -- please, not <unk>
It was a comfort for us, and we were <unk>
<unk> brothers and sisters, we have learned from her how to resist in the most difficult moments, and I'm happy to share with you that despite being an icon for women's rights and women, it's like any 16-year-old girl.
<unk> when it doesn't end his task.
They fight with your brothers, and I'm very happy for that.
People ask me, "What is special about my mentoring who has made so audacious to <unk> so brave and <unk> and <unk>
I mean, I don't wonder what I did.
<unk> what I didn't do.
It didn't cut his wings and that's it.
Thank you very much.
Thank you. Thank you very much. Thank you.
I was <unk> in the brain, 18 years ago, and from that day, the science of the brain has become a personal passion.
I'm engineering.
I want to tell you that I've recently joined the Google group of Google, where I've had a <unk> to my <unk> the <unk> of Google X-ray. But all the work I'm talking about today about the science today -- I did before I join Google or outside of my work there.
Having said this, there is a stigma when you get to a brain operation.
Are you still like smart or not?
It's not going to be like that, you'll be <unk>
After the <unk> I was missing a part of the brain, and I had to live with it.
It wasn't gray, but it was the dead part of the center that creates important hormones and <unk>
Immediately after the operation, I had to decide what to take, from more than a dozen chemicals every day, because if I didn't take anything, they would die in a few hours.
Every day, for the last 18 years, I've had to decide about the combinations of chemicals, and we can try to get them to stay alive.
More than once I've saved me.
But luckily, I have a soul of <unk> by what I decided to do is to try and get the <unk> dose, because there is no really clear map that tells you in <unk>
I started testing with different <unk> and I was shocked by seeing how small changes in the dose of <unk> dramatically my sense of who I was, my sense of who I think, my behavior with others.
A particularly <unk> case for a few months, I tried a dose and chemical doses for a man, and I was surprised by looking at how I would look at my thoughts.
I was always <unk> I was thinking about all the time on sex, and I thought it was the most intelligent person around the world, and --  -- of course, many times in the past I've met various types of things, or maybe some versions of the <unk>
It turned out as a extreme.
But my great surprise was that I wasn't trying to be <unk>
In fact, I was <unk> a little bit <unk> to fix a problem that had in front of it, and it simply doesn't happen.
So I couldn't handle it.
I changed my <unk>
But I think that experience I gave me a new appreciation of men and what they have to <unk> Since then I have been better with men.
What I was trying to do is that the adjust of the adjust those hormones and neurotransmitters and others, it was to restore my intelligence after the disease and the <unk> my creative thinking, my <unk>
<unk> thinking almost always in images, and that became my point of key reference, how can I get those mental imagery to create <unk> my ideas, if they were <unk> new ideas and <unk>
This kind of thoughts is not new.
<unk> as <unk> Descartes and <unk> look at things in the same way.
They thought that images and ideas were the same thing.
Today there are people who challenge this idea, and there are a lot of discussions about how the mind works, to me is a simple thing, for most of us, the mental imagery are fundamental for thinking and <unk>
So, after several years, I can find the point right now, and I have a lot of great <unk> mental <unk> really sophisticated sophisticated and <unk>
Now, I'm working on how to bring these mental images, from my mind to the computer screen.
Can you imagine what would happen if a movie director would be able to use its imagination only to lead to the world that has the way?
Or if a musician could extract the music from your head?
There are incredible possibilities with this, like the way people creative people can get to share the speed of light.
And the truth is, the only difficulty to do this is simply increase the resolution of our brain scanning systems.
Let me show you why I think we're pretty close to doing this with two recent experiments that were done by two major groups in neuroscience.
They both used MRI technology, image of functional MRI, to represent the brain -- you can see the brain scan done by <unk> <unk> and his colleagues at Harvard.
The column on the left shows the brain scan of a person who looks at an image.
The middle column shows the brain scan of that same individual as you were looking at that same image.
The column on the right is created <unk> the content of the upper left. You see that the difference is almost <unk>
This <unk> in many different individuals with many different images, always with a similar outcome.
The difference between seeing an image and imagine seeing that same image is almost <unk>
Now, let me share another experiment. This is from the <unk> lab in Berkeley, California.
They managed to turn brain waves into visual fields.
Let's put it this way.
In this experiment, I showed you hundreds of hours of YouTube videos, while they were <unk> their brains to create a large set of reactions in the brain sequences.
And then they showed them a film with new images -- new animals, new animals, and as much as a new <unk>
And the computer, using just the brain information from the scan of scanning the <unk> to show what it seemed like the person was looking at.
On the right you can see the <unk> of the computer, and on the left, the video I showed you.
This gave us <unk>
We're right close to this.
We just need to improve the resolution.
And now, remember, when you see an image and when you can imagine that same picture, you think of the brain the same <unk>
This has been done with the largest brain scan systems available today, and their resolution was a thousand times in the last few years.
Now we need to increase resolution a thousand times more to get a deeper look.
How do you <unk>
There are a lot of techniques to do it.
One is opening up the skull and introduce electrodes.
I don't give you that one.
A lot of you are proposing new techniques from projected to images, even <unk> <unk> with the recent result of MRI -- we need to ask the following, this technology will be the end of the country.
The conventional wisdom says that the only way to get higher resolution is to the larger, but at this point, more <unk> magnets only provide little improvements in the resolution, not increases by thousands like we need.
I propose this idea: rather than magnets bigger, let's make better magnets.
We can create much more complex structures with slightly different arrangements like making a <unk>
And why does this matter?
In the last few years, a huge amount of effort on MRI was to make really large, right?
But most of the recent breakthroughs in <unk> of clever and bright solutions in <unk> and <unk> in the mosquitos and <unk> radio displays in MRI systems.
At their time, instead of a magnetic field -- <unk> patterns -- magnetic patterns <unk> the frequencies of <unk>
So when you combine the magnetic patterns with the patterns of the processing radio processing processing -- we can increase the massive form of information that you can extract in a single <unk>
In addition, we can then divide into layers of our growing knowledge of the brain structure and memory to create the increase in the thousands that we need.
When we use <unk> we should be able to measure not only the blood of blood <unk> but the <unk> and <unk> that I mentioned and perhaps even the neural activity of this is the dream.
Will we be able to <unk> our ideas in shape direct media.
Can you imagine if we could move above the language and communicate directly through the <unk>
What would we be <unk>
And how do we learn to deal with the truths of human thinking without <unk>
You thought the Internet is a big thing.
These are great questions.
It would be <unk> to use it as a tool to amplify our thinking of thinking and communication.
Certainly, this same tool could lead to the cure of Alzheimer's and similar diseases.
We have a few more options that will open this door.
Anyway, you choose one year, will happen in five or 15 years?
It's hard to imagine it will take a lot more.
We need to learn how to take this step together.
Thank you.
I'm going to talk to you this night about the closet, and not in a traditional sense, not just from the gay time."
I think we all have <unk>
Her closet may be telling any person for the first time that the loves loves or say to someone who is pregnant, or tell someone to have cancer, or any other difficult conversation that you have to put in life.
This is all a difficult conversation, and even though our issues can vary <unk> the experience of having lived and have come out of that closet is universal.
It's fear, and we don't like it, and it must happen.
A lot of years ago, I was working on the South Side <unk> <unk> a restaurant in the city, and I had to go through several stages of the intensity of <unk> <unk> not <unk> my armpits, to quote the letters of <unk> gave <unk> as a <unk>
And I will be on the slope of my pants short, and I would have <unk> my head -- I was doing a little bit of me -- I would usually ask a kid -- "Hey, you're a kid or <unk>
And there'd be a uncomfortable silence on the table.
<unk> my jaw a little bit more, I would take my coffee with a <unk>
The father <unk> <unk> the newspaper and mother wore a cold, look at his son.
But I would say anything, and I would say <unk>
And I got to the point that every time I went to a place where there was a kid between three and 10 years, I was ready to fight.
And that's a terrible feeling.
So I promised the next time I would say something.
I should have that hard conversation.
So after a few weeks, it came again.
"You're a guy or a <unk>
A family silence, but this time I was about to get in full of the female issues at the table.  I had the quotes from Betty <unk>
<unk> <unk>
Even a piece of the "Vagina Monologues," the <unk>
So I take it deep and I went down to my back a little girl, and my back a little girl in four years with a pink dress, looking at what is not a challenge for a feminist, <unk> just a little girl with a question: "You're a kid or <unk>
And so I take it deep back again, and I got out of <unk> close to her, and I said, "Hey, I know this is something beauty.
I have the short hair like a boy, and he looked at a little boy, but I'm a girl, and you know, as well as you like to use a pink dress, and sometimes you like to use a comfortable pajamas.
I am a little bit of the kind of girl from a pajamas.
And that girl looked at me <unk> and he said, "My favorite front is <unk> and it has a fish.
Can you give me a <unk> for <unk>
And that was everything. It's only go, OK. Are you a girl.
What about the <unk> who <unk>
It was the easiest conversation that I ever ever had.
And by <unk> because the girl in the <unk> and I, both of us were <unk> one with the other.
So as many of us, I've lived in some <unk> in my life, and yes, often, my walls used to be a <unk>
But inside, in the dark, you can't know what color is the walls.
You just know how one feels living in a closet.
It's like my closet is not different from yours or yours or yours.
I will give you 100 reasons why they go out of my closet more difficult than coming out of his, but this is the <unk> The hard thing is not <unk>
The hard thing is hard.
Who can tell me that to explain to someone who has declared online banking is harder than saying it has been <unk>
Who can tell me that this story that I'm telling you is harder than to tell your son of five years that you're going to <unk>
There's no more difficult, there's only a difficult thing.
We need to stop classifying what is difficult to be difficult to another person to make us feel better or worse in relation to our closet and we must just feel empathy because we all live something difficult.
At some point in our lives, we all live in <unk> and you can make sense security, or at least more security than the other side of the door.
But I'm here to tell you that it doesn't matter what their walls are made -- a closet is not a place to live.
Thank you.  Imagine yourself 20 years ago.
I, who had a horse tail, a dress and <unk> shoes.
It was not the militant gay lesbian ready to fight for any child in four years that would fit in the coffee.
I was frozen by <unk> <unk> in one corner of my dark closet <unk> my <unk> gay, and the moving only one muscle is the scariest thing I've ever done.
My family, my family friends, strangers with whom I've spent my entire life trying to <unk> and now the world was going back to purpose.
He was burning the pages of a script that we've all followed for so long, but if you don't shoot that <unk> you kill you.
One of my most memorable launches was in my sister.
It was the first time that many people were invited to know that he was gay, and when I was making my lady <unk> and <unk> I walked around the tables and finally came to one where the friends were my parents, people who were known to me.
And after talking a moment, one of the women cried <unk> to Nathan <unk>
And the battle of the gay narrative had begun.
<unk> you had ever been in the <unk>
"Well, yeah, the truth is that we have friends in St. Petersburg.
"Well, we've never gone there, but we've heard it's <unk>
<unk> you know my <unk> <unk>
It's very good and never talked about having <unk>
<unk> What is your favorite TV show.
Our favorite program Will and Grace <unk>
And you know who <unk> <unk>
Jack is our <unk>
And then a woman, <unk> but wait to show desperately their support, to get me able to know that I was on my side, he finally said, "Well, sometimes my husband is using <unk>
And I had an opportunity at that moment, like all the <unk> <unk>
<unk> could have been easy to indicate where they felt <unk>
It's not very difficult to find them and realize that they were <unk>
And what else can you ask someone, but <unk>
If you're going to be authentic with somebody, you have to be prepared for the authentic thing that you get.
That's how hard conversations are still going to be my strong point.
Ask anyone who I have ever met.
But I'm getting better, and I follow what I like to call the three principles of Girl <unk>
Now, please see this through the gay perspective, but understand that what it involves going out of any closet is essentially the same.
Number one: Be real.
<unk> <unk> Be yourself.
That girl in coffee didn't have <unk> but I was ready for battle.
If you want someone to be <unk> the others must know that we also suffer.
Number two: Be <unk> simply <unk> <unk> your <unk>
If you know they're gay, <unk>
If they say to their parents that maybe they could be gay, they would keep the hope that it could change.
They will not give you a false hope.
And number three, and more important --  Let the complex ones.
You communicate your truth.
You never have to get rid of that.
And some of them can be injured safe injured what they've done, but it's never sorry about what they are.
And yes, maybe some of you feel <unk> but that something in them, not in you.
Those are the expectations of what you are, but not your own.
That's the story of them, but not of you.
The only story that matters is that you want to write.
So the next time you find yourself in a dark time, <unk> a <unk> you must know that we've all been there before.
And you may feel too themselves, but they're not.
Thank you, <unk> Enjoy the <unk>
<unk> what is that?
If you look at the story of how the intelligence has seen a intelligence, a productive example has been the famous quote by <unk> <unk> that "The question if a machine can think of this is as interesting as the question of whether an submarine can be <unk>
When <unk> <unk> wrote this as a critical to the pioneers of computing as Alan <unk>
And so, a few years ago, I would take a program to try to understand the fundamental physical mechanisms underlying intelligence.
So let's take a step.
We first start with a mental experiment.
Imagine that you're from an ongoing race that you don't know anything about the Earth of Earth or the <unk> of Earth, but they have incredible telescopes and you can look at the Earth, and they have incredibly long lives, so you can look at the Earth for millions, even billions of years.
And you see a very strange effect.
Of course, as <unk> we know that the reason we are trying to save ourselves.
We're trying to avoid an impact.
But if you're from an alien race that doesn't know anything about this, which doesn't have any concept of intelligence on Earth, you can see it compelled to develop a physical theory that explains how, to some point in time, the asteroids that are <unk> the surface of a planet -- they stop doing it.
And that's why I claim that this is the same question that of understanding the physical nature of intelligence.
So in this program that took several years ago, I looked at a variety of issues through science, through various disciplines, that I think, I think, to a single underlying mechanism of intelligence.
In <unk> for example, there have been a variety of evidence that our universe seems to be able to be accurately correlated for the development of intelligence, and in particular, for the development of universal states that will increase the diversity of possible future.
Finally, in the planning of robotic movement, there have been a variety of recent techniques that have tried to harness the skills of robots to maximize the future freedom of action in order to perform complex tasks.
And so, taking all of these different themes and <unk> together, I said, for a number of years, there is a mechanism underlying intelligence that we can extract from all these different <unk>
There's only one equation for <unk>
And I think the answer is yes. What you're seeing is probably the closest equivalent to a E = <unk> for intelligence that I have seen.
So what you're seeing here is a statement that intelligence is a force that intelligence is a force, F, that acts in order to maximize the future freedom of action.
It acts to maximize the future freedom of action, or to keep the open options with a force -- with the diversity of possible future accessible, yes, to an impending future, <unk>
In a nutshell, the intelligence doesn't like to be <unk>
The intelligence is trying to maximize the future freedom of action and keep it open.
And so, given this equation, it's natural to ask: What can you do with this?
How <unk> is it?
<unk> the level of human <unk>
<unk> intelligence <unk>
So I'm going to show you now a video that I think, will show some of the amazing applications of this simple equation.
Narrator: <unk> research in cosmology have suggested that universes that produce more disorder or <unk> during their life should be a trend more favorable conditions for intelligent beings like us.
But what if that <unk> connection between entropy and intelligence is a more <unk> relationship.
What if intelligent behavior is not only correlated with the production of entropy in the long term, but it actually goes directly from it?
To find out, we developed a software engine called <unk> designed to maximize the production of entropy in any time in which you find it.
Amazingly, <unk> could spend multiple animal testing, play games of humans, and even make money <unk> and they even have to make money <unk> and all of it without being asked to do that.
Here are some examples of <unk> in action.
Just like a <unk> human standing here we see <unk> <unk> automatically a pole using a <unk>
This behavior is remarkable partly because we never gave him a goal.
He just decided for her to balance the <unk>
This ability to balance is going to have applications for nuclear robotics and human delivery technologies.
This ability to use tools will have applications in intelligent manufacturing and agriculture.
In addition, just like some other animals can cooperate throwing them off the opposite end of a rope at the same time to release the food, here we see that <unk> can perform a version of the task model.
This capacity of cooperation has interesting implications for economic planning and in a variety of other fields.
<unk> is widely applicable in a variety of <unk>
So for example, here you can successfully be able to successfully play a game of <unk> against itself, <unk> their potential for play.
Here we see <unk> orchestrate new connections in a social network where the friends are constantly <unk> and it keeps the network right connected.
This same network capacity of network also has applications in health care, energy and intelligence.
So here we see <unk> organize the routes of a fleet of boats, and they will find success and using the Panama Canal to extend globally from the Atlantic to the Pacific.
In the same way, <unk> is widely applicable in defense and logistics and transportation.
Finally, here we are spontaneously going to find out and run a <unk> strategy in a simulated array of <unk> <unk> in a simulated array of actions, successfully increasing assets under their exponentially.
This ability for risk management ability will have tremendous applications in finance and secure.
Alex <unk> What you've seen is that a variety of brands of intelligent cognitive behaviors like the use of tools, walking upright and social cooperation -- all flow from one equation, which leads to a system to maximize your future freedom of action.
Now, here's a profound <unk>
So let's go back to the beginning of the use of the term -- the <unk> work -- there was always the concept that if you were <unk> smart machines, there would be a <unk> rebellion of it.
The machines are <unk> against us.
One of the biggest consequences of this work is that maybe all of these decades, we've had all the concept of rebellion <unk> the other way.
It's not that machines first become smart and then <unk> and try to take over the world.
It's all the opposite, that the urge to take control of all possible possible is a more fundamental principle than the intelligence of intelligence, that general intelligence can actually arise from taking control rather than being backwards.
Another important consequence is the pursuit of the target.
They often ask me, how is it that looking for targets to go through this kind of <unk>
My equivalent to that statement to go to the descendants of helping them build artificial artificial artificial intelligence, or to help them understand human intelligence, it's the following: The intelligence has to be seen as a physical process that tries to maximize the future freedom of action and avoiding the constraints in their own future.
Thank you very much.
We're at an inflection point in human history, something between the sake of stars and losing the planet we call <unk>
Although, in the last few years, we've expanded our understanding of how the Earth fits in the context of the universe.
The Kepler <unk> has discovered thousands of possible planets orbiting other stars, which points to the Earth is only one among the billions of planets in our galaxy.
Kepler is a Space Telescope which measures the faint range of stars when the planets go ahead of them, and blocking a little bit of that light that we have.
The data gathered by Kepler shows the sizes of planets in addition to the distance that there are between them and their stem star.
And together, this helps us understand whether these planets are small and <unk> like the Earth planets of our solar system, and also the amount of light that they get from their brains.
At his time, this is clues about whether these planets that we find are habitable or not.
Unfortunately, while we're finding this trove of that we are potentially <unk> our own planet is <unk> under the weight of humanity.
<unk> was the hotter recorded.
<unk> and sea ice that has been with us for millennia now are disappearing in a matter of decades.
These environmental changes that we've caused to a global scale have been rapidly <unk> our ability to disrupt its course.
But I am not the weather scientist or a <unk>
We study the <unk> of the planet influenced by the stars, with the hope to find places in the universe where to discover life beyond our planet.
I could say that I'm looking for alien opportunities in the property sector.
Now, as someone really interested in search for life in the universe I can tell you that the more I look for planets like the Earth, the more I enjoy our own planet.
Each of these new worlds invites a comparison between the newly discovered planet and the planets that we know better -- our solar system.
Let's take our neighbor Mars.
Mars is small and <unk> and despite being a little further from the Sun, it can be considered a potentially <unk> world, shown this by a mission like <unk>
In fact, it's possible that Mars has been habitable in the past and part of part, that's why we study so much to Mars.
Our <unk> like <unk> track their surface in search of clues about the origins of life as we know it.
The satellites that are <unk> like the <unk> mission, they take samples from the atmosphere and try to understand how Mars has been able to lose their <unk>
The private companies now provide not only short space flights but also <unk> chance of living on Mars.
But even though all of these <unk> images remind us to the deserts of our planet, places that are linked in our imagination with the ideas of ideas and <unk> compared to the Earth, Mars is a pretty terrible place to live in.
Let's take the extension of the <unk> areas of our planet that are still on <unk> places that are actually <unk> compared to Mars.
Even in the most dry places and more <unk> the air is cool and filled with oxygen <unk> by our forests at thousands of miles away.
I worry that this excitement by the colonization, of Mars and other planets going to get a big and sad <unk> the implication and the belief that Mars would expect there to save us from this <unk> <unk> of the only planet that we know that it's truly livable the Earth.
For much that I like <unk> exploration, I'm in deep disagreement with this idea.
There's a lot of good reasons to go to Mars, but to say that Mars will be there to <unk> humanity is like imagine the captain of the Titanic will tell us that the party will actually have place later in the <unk> <unk>   Thank you.
But the goals for <unk> exploration and behavioral preservation is not <unk>
No, they are actually faces of the same <unk> the goal of understanding, preserve and improve life in the future.
The extreme environments present in our world look like <unk> aliens.
They only find closer to home.
If we can understand how to create and maintain <unk> spaces, in the hostile areas of the ground, we may be able to meet the need to preserve our environment and go beyond that.
I leave you with a <unk> <unk> <unk>
A lot of years ago, the physicist Enrico Fermi said, having in mind that our universe has existed for a long time, and we hope that there were a lot of planets in this universe, we should have found evidence of alien life so far.
Well, where are they?
Well, a possible solution to the paradox of Fermi is that when civilizations become advanced enough to consider to continue in between the stars, they lose the notion of how important it is to protect the origin of the planets that are going to develop this development.
It's arrogant to think that only urban colonization, will save us from ourselves, but the planetary preservation and <unk> exploration can work together.
If we really believe in our ability to make the hostile environments of Mars for human presence, then we should be able to overcome the problem even easier to preserve the <unk> on Earth.
Thank you.
A few years ago, I got my own house.
And while I was on the front porch looking at my pockets, I realized I didn't have the keys.
In fact, I could see the window that they were on the dining table, where there were <unk>
So quickly I tried to open all the other doors and windows and they were all right.
I thought I would call a <unk> at least I had my cell phone, but at midnight, a <unk> could take a long time to get a long time to get a long time to get a lot of time to get it back.
I couldn't go back home from my friend of Jeff to spend night because I had an early flight to Europe to the next morning, and I was <unk> from my passport and my suitcase.
<unk> expensive, but you certainly don't even more expensive than a <unk> at the middle of the night, so I thought, despite the circumstances, in the circumstances, right stopped.
I'm a neuroscientist, and I know a little bit about how the brain works under stress.
<unk> <unk> that increases the heart rate -- <unk> the levels of adrenaline and <unk> the thought.
And when I got to the counter of <unk> in the airport, I realized I had no passport.
Well, I had a lot of time to think about those eight hours without sleep.
And I started to ask myself, if there was something I could do, systems that could put in the place, which would be going to be going on, which would be going on.
Or at least if bad things happen, which is going to be a total probability of a total catastrophe, that you do.
So I started thinking about that, but to a month later, my thoughts.
I was having dinner with my colleague Danny <unk> and a little embarrassed he told him about it I broke the window, and I had forgotten my passport, and Danny shared with me who had been practicing something called <unk> hindsight
It's something that he had learned from the psychologist Gary <unk> who had written about this a few years before, known as the <unk>
Everyone knows what's the <unk>
Every time there's a disaster, a team of experts comes and tries to figure out what went wrong, right?
In the <unk> as it explains <unk> you look forward and try to figure out all the things that might be out wrong, then you try to figure out what can do to prevent things to be going to be going on or to minimize the damage.
So what I want to talk to you about with you is some things that we can do in the form of a <unk>
Some of them are <unk> others are not so evident.
I'm going to start with the obvious ones.
At the house, we would get a place for the things that are <unk>
This sounds of common sense, and it is, but there's a lot of science that supports this <unk> based on how our space memory.
There's a structure in the brain called hippocampus, which has evolved over thousands of years, to make a track of the location of the important things, where you are, where you are, where the fish are, where the <unk> trees live where the tribes and <unk>
The hippocampus is the part of the brain that was <unk> in the <unk> in London.
It's the part of the brain that allows the <unk> to find their nuts.
And if you ask if someone really did the experiment, they cut the sense of <unk> <unk> and they could still find their nuts.
They didn't use the smell, but the hippocampus, that very evolved mechanism of the brain to find things.
But it's really good for things that don't move much, not as good for things that are going on.
This is the reason for losing keys in the car, reading glasses and <unk>
So in the house you can see a place for keys, a hook along with the door, maybe a <unk> dish.
For your passport, a particular mistake.
For your reading, a particular <unk>
If you pick up a place and they are <unk> with it all of your stuff is always going to be there when the <unk>
What about <unk>
Take the cell phone a picture of your credit cards of your credit cards for the mail to the cloud.
If these things are lost or <unk> it can facilitate the <unk>
These are some of the most obvious things.
Remember, when you're under stress, the brain releases <unk>
<unk> is toxic and <unk> the thought.
So part of the <unk> practice is to recognize that under stress we won't be at the best moment, and you have to put systems on their site.
And there's perhaps not more stressful situation that when you're faced with a medical decision.
And at some point, we're all going to be in that situation, to have to make a very important decision about the future of our medical care or a loved one, to help them with a decision.
And so I want to talk about that.
And I'll talk about a very particular medical condition.
But this is <unk> as a <unk> for all of it takes of medical decisions, and in fact for the decision-making and social decisions and social decisions, any kind of decision that we need to take out of that would benefit a rational assessment of the facts.
So suppose you go to the doctor and the doctor says, "I've got the result of the lab and your cholesterol is a little bit <unk>
You all know that high cholesterol is associated with a higher risk of heart disease, heart attack, heart attack.
So you're thinking that you have high cholesterol is the best, then the doctor says, "I'd like to <unk> a drug that will help you reduce the <unk> a <unk>
And maybe you have heard about the <unk> and you know it's one of the most successful drugs in the world today, you even have to know people who are <unk>
So you think, "Yes, <unk> <unk>
But there's a question that you have to do then, a statistic that you must ask for the most doctors don't want to speak, and companies companies even less.
It's for the <unk> the number you need to treat.
And what is this, the <unk>
It's the number of people who have to take a drug or giving surgery in any medical procedure before you help one person.
And you must think about what kind of statistical statistic is <unk>
The number needs to be one.
My doctor didn't give me something if it wasn't to help me.
But actually, medical practice doesn't work like this.
And it's not a fault of the doctor, and if it's guilt from somebody, it's from scientists like me.
We have not understood the <unk> mechanisms.
But the estimates of <unk> that 90 percent of the drugs works only about 30 to 50 percent of the people.
So the number you need to treat the most broadly <unk> what do you think is it?
How many people have to take it before you help one person?
300.
This is according to the research of cynical researchers <unk> <unk> and Pamela <unk> <unk> <unk>
I can explore the numbers.
300 people have to take the drug for a year before avoiding a single heart attack, heart attack, or another <unk> event.
Now, maybe you think, "Well, one probability in 300 of the way down my <unk>
Why do not, <unk> <unk> the recipe for all <unk>
But then you have to ask for a more statistical statistic and it is, <unk> from the <unk> effects, right?
For this particular drug, the side effects are produced by five percent of the patients.
And those include things that are <unk> <unk> or muscle pain and <unk> pain -- but now they're thinking, "The Five percent is not very likely to go to me, even if you take the <unk>
But a moment.
Remember that under stress doesn't think clearly.
So think about how you can do this with time, so you don't have to make the chain of reasoning in the act.
300 people take the drug, right? A person has been <unk> five percent of the 300 people have side effects, that's 15 people.
You have 15 times more likely to get out of the drug to help you the drug.
I don't say they should or not take the <unk>
I just say that they must have this conversation with your doctor.
The medical ethic requires, is part of the principle of informed consent.
We have a right to have access to this kind of information to start the conversation about whether you want to take your risks or not.
Maybe you're thinking that I've launched this number in the air of the crash, but actually this number necessary to treat is quite typical.
For the surgery that is done in the largest men of 50, <unk> from prostate cancer, the number you need to treat is <unk>
So 30 surgeries for a person who has <unk>
And the side effects in that case, they produce in 50 percent of the patients.
Those include helplessness or erectile <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
And if you are lucky, and it's one of that 50 percent of the effects of only one year or two.
So the idea of <unk> is to think before the questions that you can argue that we would have conversation forward.
You don't have to make all this on the act.
And they also want to think about quality of life.
Because you have a choice, sometimes you want a more short life free of pain, or a longer life that might have a lot of pain to the end?
These are the things that they speak and think about now, with their family and their loved ones.
They can change in the heat of the moment, but at least you're trained in this kind of thought.
Remember, our brain releases <unk> under stress, and one of the things that happens at that moment is that you turn a lot of systems.
There's an evolutionary reason for this.
<unk> with a predatory system, you don't need the <unk> system or the <unk> or the immune system, because if the body is spending the metabolism on those things, it won't react to be the lunch lunch so that none of that matters.
Unfortunately, one of the things that goes through the window during those stress moments is the rational logical thinking, like Danny <unk> and his colleagues have shown.
So we have to think about the future of these kinds of situations.
I think what's important here is to recognize that we're all <unk>
We're all going to fail to fail to time.
The idea is to think about the future how those <unk> could be those <unk> to put systems in the place that will help us minimize the harm, or to prevent the bad things in the first place.
<unk> on the night of snow in <unk> when I came back from my journey, my contractor installed a <unk> of combination with a key door to the front door, an easy way to remember it.
And I have to admit that I still have lots of letters that I haven't ordered and lots of messages that I haven't seen.
So I'm not very organized, but I see the organization as a process -- and I'm doing it.
Thank you very much.
Interpreter: <unk> <unk> is my favorite <unk>
It means playing <unk>
If you're playing a musical instrument and you see a <unk> in the <unk> you need to play <unk>
Two <unk> even harder.
Four <unk> extremely smooth.
This is my drawing of a <unk> tree there, and you see that it doesn't matter how many thousands and thousands of <unk> can never come to a complete silence.
That's my current definition of <unk> a very dark sound.
I'd like to share a little bit about the story of the American system of signs, <unk> in addition to a little bit of my own story.
The language of French signs came over the decade in 1800, and over the time of time, it <unk> with local signs, and it developed the language that we know as <unk>
So it has a story about 200 years.
I was born <unk> and I was taught to believe that sound was not a part of my life.
And I thought it was true.
I now realize that it's not true for nothing.
<unk> are a very important part of my life, they're really in my mind every day.
As a <unk> person who lives in a sound world, it's like I lived in a foreign country, <unk> <unk> their rules, <unk> behaviors and norms without <unk>
So how do I understand sound like?
Well, I see how people behave and respond to sound.
People are like my little speakers, and <unk> sound.
<unk> and <unk> that behavior.
At the same time, I've learned that I can create sound, and I've seen how people answers.
So I learned, for example ...
"Don't <unk> <unk>
"Don't do a lot of noise to eat the bag of chips <unk>
"Don't <unk> and when you're eating, sure not <unk> <unk> <unk>
All of this is called <unk> <unk>
Maybe I think of the sound label more than the average person does it.
I'm super <unk> of sounds.
And I'm always waiting with <unk> the sound that's going to be next.
From there, this drawing.
<unk>
<unk> to move on.
<unk> by <unk>
You can see that <unk> doesn't have notes in the lines.
That's because the lines already contain sounds through the <unk> <unk> and <unk>
In <unk> culture, the movement is the equivalent of sound.
This is the signal for <unk> in the <unk>
A typical <unk> has five lines.
However, to me, do this with my thumb that doesn't feel natural.
That's why I just got four lines on the paper.
In 2008, I had the opportunity to travel to Berlin, Germany, for an artistic house, there.
Before this time, I was working like <unk>
During this summer, I visited museums and spaces of different <unk> and as I went from one place to another, I realized there was no visual art there.
At that moment, the sound was the trend and that called me the <unk>
There was no visual art, everything was <unk>
Now sound has come into my territory of art.
I'm going to tell you more about art?
I realized that it doesn't have to be like this.
In fact, I know the sound.
I know it so well that it doesn't just experience through your ears.
I can feel this <unk> or experience visually, or even as an idea.
So I decided to reclaim the sound of sound and <unk> in my art practice.
And all that they had taught me in terms of sound, I decided to leave it and <unk>
I started to create a new body of work.
And when I presented it to the art community, I was <unk> with the amount of support and attention that I got.
I realized that sound is like money, the power, the <unk> social currency.
In the bottom of my mind, I always felt that the sound was <unk> it was something of a random person.
And the sound is so powerful that it could be <unk> to me and my artistic job, or I could tell me.
I chose to tell you that I was given.
There's a massive culture around the language.
And just because I don't use my literal voice to communicate, the eyes of society is like I had no voice at all.
So I have to work with people who can be supported by the same way and become my voice.
That way I'm able to be relevant in the current society.
So in school, in the work and institutions, work with many different performers from <unk>
And his voice becomes my voice and identity.
They help me to be <unk>
And their voices have value and weight.
Ironically, when you ask <unk> your voices, I'm able to keep a temporary form of value as well as you take a loan from a very high interest rate.
If you won't continue with this practice, I feel that I might be able to get it in the <unk> and not having any social value.
So with sound as my new artistic medium is in the world of music.
And I was surprised by looking at the similarities between music and <unk>
For example, a musical note cannot capture and express on the paper.
And the same thing can be said from a concept in <unk>
The two are very <unk> and highly <unk> what means that subtle changes can affect all of the meaning as well as the sounds.
I'd like to share with you a metaphor of the piano, so you understand better how the <unk> works.
So, imagine a piano.
<unk> <unk> <unk> in many different <unk>
If it's <unk> a different <unk> for every finger as the facial expression, the movement of the body, the speed, the shape of the body, the speed, the shape of the hand -- the way the piano hits the piano, the English is a linear language, as if you get a key to the time.
However, <unk> is more like a <unk> you need the 10 fingers in the way to express a clear concept or idea in <unk>
If just a key thing to change the <unk> it would create a completely different meaning.
The same thing happens with music in the <unk> <unk> and volume.
In <unk> when you use these different parameters -- <unk> you can express different ideas.
For example, the <unk> sign on that."
This is the <unk> sign on that."
I'm seeing.
<unk> <unk>
Oh, <unk>
<unk> oh.
What are you <unk>
Ah, <unk>
So I started thinking, and if I see the <unk> through the glasses of music?
If I had to create a sign and you would take it over and again, it could be like a piece of visual music.
For example, this is the <unk> sign goes out and you're wearing.
This is all day."
If you look at it, and you shake the visually speed, visually speed looks like a piece of music.
All day.
I feel that the same thing can be said about <unk> <unk>
All the <unk>
This is all night in this drawing.
And this led me to think about three different types of <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> -- <unk> <unk>
I feel that the third has more <unk> than the other two.
This is what the time is expressed in <unk> and how the distance to the body can express the changes in time.
For example, one <unk> is a hand, two <unk> -- it's two hands, the present gets closer and in front of the body, the future is in front of the body and the past is on the back.
So the first example is <unk> a lot of time."
Then, <unk> <unk> <unk> and the last one, which is my favorite idea, and it's a very romantic idea at the time, and it's going to be a again."
<unk> <unk> is a music term with a specific rate of four times by <unk>
However, when I look at the word <unk> <unk> I think automatically at the same time."
Watch <unk> hand. <unk> left hand.
We have the <unk> through head and chest.
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> I'm going to show you a way of the hand called <unk> <unk>
Can you do with me?
All of your hands in high.
Now we're going to do it so much in the head as the chest -- something like <unk> <unk> or <unk> same time."
Yes, good.
That means <unk> in the international system.
The international system, as a note, is a visual tool to help communicate in all cultures and language languages all over the world.
The second one I'd like to show you is this one. Please do it again.
And now this.
It means <unk> in the <unk>
Now, the third one: Please ask him again.
And over again.
It's <unk> in the <unk>
We're going to do the three together.
<unk> <unk> and <unk>
Good job.
Look at how the three signs are very similar. They all happen in your head and the chest. But they carry on very different meanings of it.
It's amazing to see how the <unk> is alive and wealthy as music.
However, today, we live in a very <unk> world.
And just because <unk> doesn't have a sound, it doesn't have social value.
We need to start questioning what defines social value and allow the <unk> to develop its own value, without sounds.
And this could be a step to make a more <unk> society.
And maybe people will understand that you don't have to be deaf to learn <unk> I don't have to hear music.
<unk> is a rich trove of trove and I'd like you to have the same experience.
I'd like to invite you to open your ears, open your eyes, to participate in our culture and experience our visual language.
And you never know, they can be in love with us.
Thank you.
<unk> <unk> Hey, that's me.
As a child, my parents would say, "You can fix it, but then you have to <unk>
<unk> involves responsibility.
But my imagination led me to all these wonderful places where everything was possible.
So I grew up in a visualization of innocence or a bubble of ignorance must say, because adults would lie to us to protect us from the horrible truth.
When I got older, I found out that adults are also <unk> and that they're not very good to clean people's people.
The country, now I'm now an adult and teach citizens and invention in the <unk> school in Hong Kong.
You don't have to wait a lot for my students to walk through the beach <unk> with lots of trash.
So as good citizens, we cleaned up the <unk> and not, it's not drinking alcohol, and if it is, I don't know it.
It's sad to say, but over 80 percent of the oceans contain plastic.
It's kind of creepy.
And in the last few decades, we've been coming out with these big vessels and networks, to collect those pieces of plastic to study them under the microscope, and the <unk> and <unk> this information on a map.
But lasts with an eternity and it's very expensive and it's also very <unk> to use those huge steps.
So along with my students, with ages six to 15 years, we dream to invent a better way.
We've transformed our tiny classroom in Hong Kong in a workshop.
We started building this <unk> <unk> work so that kids are very <unk> they can also participate.
And I'm going to tell you the kids that manipulate electrical tools feel great and secure.
Not exactly.
Let's go back to plastic.
We collect plastic and we reduce it into the size of the ocean, which is very small, because of its <unk>
That we do.
I leave you to the imagination of my students.
My job is to try to take the best ideas of every child and try to engage them in something that we hope to work.
We decided instead of collecting pieces of plastic, just <unk> information.
Through the use of a robot, we took a picture of this <unk> the kids will get a lot of the robots.
And then we started very quickly what we call "a <unk>
We're so fast in creating prototypes that we ended up before lunch.
And we turn light bulbs and web cameras on zoom in, and we turned it into a floating robot, which is slowly moving through the water and the plastic that we have there, and this is the image captured by the robot.
We see pieces of plastic floating down slowly through the sensor while the computer on board will process this image and measure the size of each <unk> to get a measure of how many plastic in the water.
<unk> this invention step into a website for inventors called <unk> with the hope that someone would make it even more.
The great thing about this project is that students saw a local problem, and <unk> are trying to bridge it immediately.
I put together my <unk> problem, but my students in Hong Kong are very <unk>
Do you see the news, <unk> the Internet, and you get <unk> with this image: <unk>
A child, maybe 10 years old than 10 years, cleaning an oil spill, just using the hands, in <unk> the largest <unk> forest in Bangladesh.
They were very shocked because this is the water that <unk> is the water that <unk> the water where you grow up the place where you live in.
You can also see that the water is brown and the mud and oil are also brown color, and when you all <unk> it's very hard to see what's in the water.
But there is a simple technology called <unk> which allows you to see what's in the water.
We built a first prototype of a <unk> which can lead through all kinds of substances that produce different <unk> which can help identify what's in the water.
We put this prototype with a sensor and we send it to Bangladesh.
The great thing about this project is that beyond to solve a local problem, or analyzing a local problem, my students used their empathy and their sense of creativity to help other children.
I'm forced to do a problem with <unk> I was forced to make a second experiment, and I wanted to go a little bit further away, maybe to address a more difficult problem, and it's also closer to me.
I'm half Japanese and French and probably remember, in 2011, there was a devastating earthquake in Japan.
It was so violent that we had had a number of giant waves called <unk> and those <unk> in the coast of Japan.
Over 14 people died in a second.
It also gives the nuclear energy plant from Fukushima, a nuclear station close to the water.
And today, according to the reports of an average 300 metric tons are still leaking out of the nuclear plant in the Pacific Ocean.
Today, all the Pacific Ocean has traces of pollution by <unk>
If we go to the West Coast, we can measure the radiation radiation everywhere.
But if you look at the map, it seems that most of the radiation comes out of the Japanese coast of the Japanese coast, and the majority of the moment, it has to look safe, it's blue.
Well, the reality is a little bit more complicated than that.
I've gone back to <unk> every year from the accident and research with other scientists, the land, the river, the river, and this time we wanted to take the kids.
Of course not the <unk> the parents didn't get it.
But every night we went to the center of <unk> here is the use of different masks here.
It might seem like they didn't take the serious work, but they did it because they're going to have to live with the <unk> all your life.
Along with them we discussed the data <unk> that day and we talked about what we were going to do next, the strategies, the <unk> and so on.
And to do this, we created a <unk> map of the region around the nuclear power plant.
We created the map of <unk> <unk> cycle to represent data in real time of <unk> and <unk> water to simulate the rain.
And so with this we were able to notice that the radioactive dust is <unk> from the top of the mountain to the <unk> system and <unk> in the ocean.
It was a <unk> <unk>
But based on this is we organized a civil expedition the nearest <unk> to date.
We get closer to a mile of the nuclear, and with the <unk> help of the area we were collecting sediments from the sea bed with a little bit of sediment as we invented and we've built.
Here's a <unk> we've gone from a local problem to a remote problem to a global problem.
And it's been very exciting to work on these different scales, also with open and very simple technologies.
But at the same time, it's been increasingly frustrating because we've only been starting to measure the damage that we've done.
We haven't even started trying to solve the problems.
I wonder if we should take the leap and try to invent better ways of doing all of these things.
So the classroom became a little bit so small so we found an industrial facility in Hong Kong and we convert it into the largest space dedicated to the social and environmental impact.
It's in the center of Hong Kong and it's a place where we can work with wood, metal metal, a little bit of biology, a little bit of optical biology, basically, you can build almost everything there.
It's also a place where adults can play together.
It's a place where the dreams of children can actually become the help of adults, and where adults can be children again.
<unk> <unk> <unk>
<unk> <unk> We asked questions like, we can invent the future of mobility with <unk> energy.
For example.
Or can we help in mobility in the age of age, transforming their dopamine chairs into new <unk>
The plastic, the oil and the <unk> are <unk> terrible, but the worst legacy we can leave our kids are the lies.
We cannot afford to protect the children of the awful truth because we need their imagination to invent the solutions.
So, scientists, creators -- we need to prepare to the next generation to get care about the environment and people, and so I can actually do something about it.
Thank you.
Two <unk> <unk> two radically opposite design.
One is made out of thousands of pieces of steel -- the other one of a single silk silk does.
One of them is synthetic -- the other organic.
One is a bit about the environment, it thought it was about it.
One is designed by nature, the other for it.
Michelangelo said when he looked at the <unk> <unk> he saw a figure that fights for being free.
<unk> was only a tool of Michelangelo.
But living beings are not <unk>
They grow.
And in the smallest units of life, cells, cells, we carry all the information required for every cell to work and to <unk>
The tools also have consequences.
At least since the Industrial Revolution, the world of design has been dominated by <unk> and mass production.
The assembly lines have dictated a world that is made of parts, <unk> the imagination of designers and trained architects to think of their objects like <unk> of different parts of different functions.
But you don't find <unk> material in nature.
Think of the human skin, for example.
Our facial skins are thin with <unk> <unk>
<unk> <unk> are more thick with small <unk>
You act mainly like filter, the other mainly as barrier, and yet it's the same <unk> there's no parts, there's no <unk>
It's a system that varies gradually its functionality through variation in <unk>
Here's a broken screen, which represents my view of the world <unk> the <unk> of every designer and architect to work at the work between the <unk> and the gene, is between the machine and the organism, between assembly and the organism, between Henry Ford and Charles Darwin.
These two visions of the world, my left hemisphere and the law, and <unk> shows in the two screens after me.
My work, at the most simple level, trying to unite these two visions of the world, away from the assembly and coming up to growth.
You probably ask yourself, why now?
Why wasn't it possible for 10 or even five years?
We live in a very special time in history, a rare moment, where they have four disciplines that offer designers access to the tools that we never had access to before.
And at the intersection of these four fields, my team and I create.
Please meet the minds and the hands of my students.
We design objects, products, structures and tools at the same level of scale, like this robotic arm with one reach of 24 meters in diameter with a foreign basis that someday not very far -- print <unk> buildings, and graphics at the nanoscale made of genetically engineered <unk>
Here we have <unk> the <unk> a archetype of the ancient Arab architecture, and it has created a screen where every single aperture is the only one to shape the shape of light and heat through it.
In our next project, we explored the possibility of creating a layer and a <unk> This was for a fashion fashion fashion <unk> <unk> <unk> -- it's like a second skin made of one piece, <unk> in the flexible <unk> around the waist.
Together with printing 3D printing -- we printed this layer and <unk> 3D <unk> between the cells. I will show you more objects like that.
This hull combined <unk> materials and <unk> in the resolution of 20 <unk>
This is the resolution of a human hair.
It's also the resolution of a <unk> scanner.
That designers have access to this high resolution analytical and <unk> instruments allows it to design products that are <unk> not only the shape of our bodies, but the physiological structure of our tissues.
We also designed an acoustic chair, a chair at the very structural structural time, and it also absorbs sound.
The Carter professor, my collaborator, came back to the nature for <unk> and to design this <unk> surface pattern becomes <unk>
They put this <unk> surface of 44 different properties that vary in <unk> <unk> and color, <unk> to the pressure points in the human body.
His surface, as in nature, varies their functionality not by the addition of other material or another <unk> but <unk> continuously and <unk> the material.
But it's <unk> nature.
There is no parts in nature?
I didn't grew up in a Jewish home -- but when I was young, my grandmother would tell me stories about the Bible <unk> and one of them came to me and actually define a lot of what I care about.
As she <unk> "In the third day of <unk> God sends the Earth to grow a <unk> tree, <unk>
For that first tree <unk> there would be no difference between the trunk, branches, branches, and <unk>
The whole tree was a <unk>
Instead, the earth did grow trees with branches, <unk> <unk> and flowers.
The earth created a world in fact.
I often ask myself, "What would the design be if objects would make it out of one part?
Tell a better state of the <unk>
So we looked for the <unk> material, the kind of material of the tree <unk> with fruit and we find.
The second <unk> most abundant on the planet is called <unk> and about 100 million tons of tons is produced every year by organisms, or <unk> or <unk>
We think that if we could tune their properties, we could generate <unk> structures in one piece.
So that's what we did.
We call it a legal <unk>  We asked a lot of seed <unk> the <unk> and produced <unk>
<unk> the chemical concentrations we've been able to achieve a wide range of properties, from the dark, hard and <unk> to the light, soft and transparent.
So to print the large-scale structures that built a system with multiple <unk> <unk> <unk>
So the robot could vary the properties of the material and create these structures made of a single material three feet long, 100 percent.
When the pieces are ready, it leaves it to dry in order to find a natural way to contact with air.
So why do we keep designing with <unk>
The air bubbles that were a byproduct of the printing process was used for <unk> <unk> that first appeared on the planet three billion years ago, as we heard yesterday.
Along with our collaborators at Harvard and MIT, <unk> bacteria genetically engineered to capture carbon from the atmosphere and turn it into sugar.
For the first time, we've been able to generate structures that make their transition out without problems of <unk> <unk> and if it spread even more to windows.
A <unk> tree <unk>
Working with a ancient material, one of the first forms of life on the planet, with abundant water on the planet, with abundant of synthetic biology, we've transformed a structure of <unk> of shrimp in an architecture that behaves like a tree.
And here's the best part: for objects designed for <unk> put in the sea, <unk> life <unk> and placed on the ground, they'll grow a tree.
<unk> for our next exploration using the same design principles was the solar system.
We are looking for the possibility of creating clothes to keep life for <unk>
To do that, we need to dominate the bacteria and control their flow.
So like the <unk> table, we did our own table of <unk> new forms of life created <unk> made <unk> and <unk> <unk>
I like to think about synthetic biology like the liquid <unk> only instead of <unk> metals -- and they are <unk> new biological measures inside very small channels.
This field is called <unk>
<unk> our own 3D channels to control the flow of these crops.
In our first piece of laundry -- two microorganisms.
The first is the <unk>
He lives in our oceans and in the fresh water.
And second, E. <unk> the bacteria that lives in the human <unk>
One turns light into sugar, the other consumes sugar and produces some useful biofuels for the built environment.
But these two <unk> don't interact in nature.
In fact, it's never <unk>
They are here, designed for the first time, to have a relationship on a piece of clothes.
Think of it as evolution, not natural selection, but evolution by design.
In order to contain these relationships, we've created a single channel that comes into the tract tract tract that will help us make these bacteria and to make their function of way.
So we started to grow those channels in the human body, <unk> the properties of material by <unk>
If we wanted more <unk> <unk> more transparent channels.
This system might be able to <unk> when you stretch off one end to another one, it's 60 meters.
This is half the length of a football field and 10 times more than our very early <unk>
And here it is, as a <unk> at TED, our first <unk> <unk> channels with life inside your clothes.
Thank you.
Mary <unk> said, "We are home creatures, only half is <unk>
What if design would get the other <unk>
And if we could create structures that increase the matter what the matter will be.
And if we were able to create personal <unk> that we <unk> our skin -- we would save our skin tissue, and <unk> our <unk>
Think of this as a form of editing biology.
I call this the material ecology.
For that, you always have to go back to nature.
So now, you know that a 3D printer <unk> material printer.
You also know that nature doesn't do this.
<unk> <unk> with <unk>
This cocoon of <unk> for example, creates a highly sophisticated architecture -- a home inside which is <unk>
<unk> do not <unk> on this level of <unk>
It does it through the combination of two materials, but two proteins in different <unk>
One acts as a structure, the other is the glue or the matrix, and linking those fibers to each other.
And this happens through scales.
The silk worm first works in the environment, creates a tissue structure, and then it starts <unk> a cocoon of compression.
The tension and the <unk> the two forces of life, they manifest themselves in one material.
In order to understand better how this complex process works, we attach a small magnet to the head of a silk worm to the <unk>
We put it inside of a box with magnetic sensors, and that allowed us to create this cloud of dots in three dimensions and visualize the complex architecture of cocoon of <unk>
However, when you put the silk worm in a flat patch in a flat place, we realized that <unk> a foreground and still <unk> <unk>
So we started to design different parts of different environments, and we've discovered that form, the composition, the <unk> structure is transmitted directly by the environment.
They are often <unk> the silk worms to death inside their <unk> their silk is <unk> and it is used in the <unk> industry.
We saw that designing these templates we can shape spectacular silk without boiling a single <unk>
<unk> <unk> and we could create these things.
So we climbed this process up to the architectural scale.
We had a <unk> robot, making silk, and we put ourselves in our site.
We knew that silk <unk> towards the darkest areas and <unk> so we use a solar <unk> to reveal the distribution of light and heat into our structure.
And so we created holes or <unk> to block the rays from the light and the heat, down by the silk worms on the structure.
We were ready to get to <unk>
We asked silk <unk> silk to a silk <unk>
And after <unk> four weeks, they were prepared for us.
We put them carefully on the bottom edge of the <unk> and the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and life begins again like us, but much, much more short.
<unk> Fuller said that tension is the great integrity, and he was right.
By <unk> biological silk on the <unk> <unk> <unk> give this whole pavilion out of integrity.
And in a little bit more than two or three weeks, <unk> silk worms, <unk> <unk>
In a curious symmetry, this is also the length of the <unk>
<unk> after the <unk> produce 1.5 million eggs.
This could be used for 250 extra <unk> in the future.
So here are the two visions of the world.
A <unk> silk by a robotic arm, the other full full empty arm.
If the last frontier of design is to give us life to the products and the buildings around us, to form an ecology of two materials, designers need to unite these two visions in the world.
Which brings us around, of course, at the beginning.
Here's a new era of design, a new era of creation, which brings us from a design inspired by nature to a nature inspired by the design that demands us, for the first time, that we make for nature.
Thank you.
Thank you very much. Thank you.
Raise your hand if you've ever asked you what you want to be <unk>
If you had to remember what age they had when they asked the first time this?
You can <unk> with your fingers.
Three. Five. Three. Five. Five.
Now, raise your hand if the question is, "What do you want to be <unk>
It has caused some kind of anxiety.
Anything anxiety.
I'm somebody who could never respond to the question, "What do you want to be <unk>
The problem wasn't that I had no interest, but I had <unk>
In the school I liked the English -- the <unk> and the art and learning websites, and also playing the guitar in a punk band called <unk> <unk>
Maybe you've heard of us.
And generally I like to test and persist anyway, having spent a lot of time and energy and sometimes money in this field.
But at the time this feeling of <unk> this feeling of, this feeling of, this is no longer a challenge, it comes to <unk>
And I have to give it out.
But then I'm going to tell you about something else, something totally different, and I'm going to be reminded of it, and I feel <unk> I have found <unk> and then again this point where I start to <unk>
And finally, I want to give it back.
But then I'd like to discover something new and different, and I'd like to go into that.
This pattern caused me a lot of anxiety, for two reasons.
The first one was because I wasn't sure how I was going to turn all this into a career.
I thought I had to choose one thing, denying all of my other passions, and <unk> <unk>
Another reason I had so much anxiety was a little bit more <unk>
I was worried that there was something wrong with this, and something bad in me for not <unk> at all.
I was worried about having fear of commitment, or to be <unk> or <unk> or my own success.
If you can relate to my story, and these feelings, I'd like to ask you something that I'd like to have asked me then.
<unk> themselves, where they learned to allocate the meaning of bad or abnormal to do things.
I'm going to tell you where they <unk> they learned from culture.
We ask first, "What do you want to be <unk>
When we have about five years.
And the truth is that nobody cares about what they were going to do to that age.
This is considered a naive question for making nice answers in the kids like, <unk> <unk> or <unk> <unk> or want to be <unk>
<unk> the suit.
So this question takes us over and over again as we get in various different ways, <unk> <unk> to school students, you ask them to ask you to pick up in college.
And at some point, "What do you want to be <unk>
It happens from being the nice exercise of before it takes away the dream.
Why?
If this question inspire kids to dream with what might be, don't inspire to dream with everything they might be.
In fact, just the opposite, because when someone asks you what you want to be, you can't respond to 20 different things, even though adults are likely to be <unk> and say, "Oh, how good, but you can't be <unk> and <unk>
You have to <unk>
This is Dr. Bob <unk>  and he's <unk> <unk> and <unk>
And this <unk> Amy editor made in <unk> <unk> teacher and creative love.
But most of the kids don't hear about people like this.
All you hear is they're going to have to choose.
But that's more than that.
The notion of life is very <unk> in our culture.
It's this idea of fate or the real <unk> the idea that every one of us has something to spend during this land, and you have to figure out what that thing is, and devote your life to it.
But if you're somebody who is not connected to this way?
What if there are many different issues that wake up your curiosity and many different things that want to do?
There's no place for someone like one in that framework.
And so you can feel alone.
You can feel it doesn't have a goal.
And you feel something wrong with you.
There's nothing wrong with you.
You are a <unk>
A <unk> is someone with many creative interests and creative activities.
It's a <unk>
It could help if you divide it into three <unk> <unk> and <unk>
You can also use other terms of <unk> the same idea, like <unk> <unk>
For the age of the Renaissance, the ideal was the one who was well <unk> in multiple disciplines.
Barbara <unk> refers to us as <unk>
<unk> any term you like whether or <unk> your own.
It seems like a kind of adapt to a community, we can't agree with a single identity.
It's easy to see <unk> as limitation or woe you must win.
But what I've learned from talking to people and writing about these ideas on my website, is that there are huge strengths in this way.
Here's three superpowers <unk>
One, the synthesis of ideas.
I mean, the combination of two or more fields, and creating something new in the <unk>
<unk> <unk> and Rachel <unk> <unk> their shared interests in country visualization of data, travel, math and design, when they started <unk>
<unk> is a company that creates <unk> <unk>
In <unk> and Rachel came up with this unique idea for her <unk> mix of skills and experiences.
Innovation happens at intersections.
From there comes the new ideas.
And <unk> with all their background, they can access a lot of these points of <unk>
The second superpower -- <unk> is fast learning.
When we were <unk> we're interested in something, we're going to go.
We look at all that we can have in our hands.
We're used to being <unk> by having been a lot of times in the past, and this means that we have fewer fear of testing new things and get out of our comfort.
A lot of skills are <unk> to other disciplines, and we bring all of what we've learned to every new area that we need -- so we rarely start from zero.
<unk> <unk> is a <unk> full-time writer and <unk>
As a pianist pianist -- an amazing capacity to develop muscle memory.
Now, she's the most quick known thing.
Before I become a writer, he was <unk> financial <unk>
He had to learn the most thin sales mechanics when they were starting their practice, and this ability to write compelling launches for editors.
They rarely have a waste of time to go to what you would give to you, even if you were at the end of it.
It's possible to apply that knowledge in a totally different field, in a way that you couldn't have <unk>
The third superpower -- <unk> is adaptability. I mean, the ability to turn into anything you need in a <unk> situation.
<unk> <unk> is sometimes director of videos, other web designer designer, sometimes a Kickstarter, sometimes master, and sometimes, apparently James <unk>
It's valuable because it makes good work.
He's even more valuable because it can take a lot of different <unk> depending on the needs of their customers.
<unk> Company defined adaptability as the most important skill for development, to thrive in the 21st century.
The economic world changes so rapidly and <unk> that are the individuals and organizations that can be <unk> to meet the market needs that really <unk>
<unk> of ideas, quick learning and <unk> three abilities where <unk> are very <unk> and three abilities that could be lost if they're <unk> to reduce their goals.
As a society, we have a great interest in encouraging <unk> to be themselves.
We have complex issues, <unk> right now, and we need no conventional thinkers to deal with them.
Let's say they are, in your heart <unk>
<unk> <unk> knowing because they wanted to be <unk> <unk>
Don't worry, there's nothing wrong with you.
In fact, some of the best teams came out of a specialist and a <unk> <unk>
The specialist can dive deep and put into ideas, and the <unk> gives a amplitude of knowledge to the project.
It's a beautiful relationship.
But we should all have to design lives and careers that <unk> with how we are connected.
And unfortunately, the <unk> most of them are told to be just more like your fellow <unk>
Once you said this, if there's one thing you take from this talk, I hope it's this: <unk> with the internal wiring -- whatever it is.
If you are a heart specialist then, then <unk> all the media.
That's where you will give the best of it.
But for the <unk> in the room, including those who just realize being one of them in the last 12 minutes,  I said, <unk> with your many passions.
Keep their curiosity through those <unk> <unk>
<unk> the intersections.
<unk> our internal wiring leads to a more authentic and happy life.
And perhaps most importantly, <unk> the world <unk>
Thank you.
In the year <unk> a woman named <unk> the led to a psychiatric in <unk>
<unk> <unk> and I couldn't even remember the most basic details of their life.
His doctor called <unk>
<unk> I didn't know how to help <unk> but <unk> for her until it unfortunately died in <unk>
After his death, <unk> did a <unk> and they found strange <unk> and <unk> in the brain of a guy who had never seen before.
The most amazing thing.
If you had been alive today, we could not give it more help than he <unk> he gave him <unk> years ago.
<unk> was Dr. <unk> Alzheimer's.
And <unk> <unk> the first patient in receiving a diagnosis that we now call Alzheimer's disease.
From <unk> medicine has advanced a lot.
They've been discovered antibiotics and vaccines to protect us from <unk> many treatments for cancer, antiretroviral cancer, <unk> for the <unk> and much more.
But there's a little bit of progress in the treatment of Alzheimer's.
I'm part of a team of scientists working to find a cure for Alzheimer's for a decade.
So I think about this all the time.
Alzheimer's now affects 40 million across the world.
But by 2050, it will affect 150 million of you.
If you expect to live up to 85 years or more, the possibility of Alzheimer's will be almost one of two of each two.
In other words, there's the probability of the probability that their years is going on with Alzheimer's years or helping care of a friend or wanted to be Alzheimer's disease.
In America, Alzheimer's care costs 200 billion dollars every year.
One of five dollars of health care is spent in disease disease.
Today it's the most expensive disease and its costs <unk> an increase in five times by 2050, as the generation of <unk> boom.
It may surprise you, but Alzheimer's is one of the greatest doctors and social challenges of our generation.
But it has been relatively short to <unk>
Today, one of the top 10 causes of death from all over the world, Alzheimer's is the only one that cannot be able to cure or even slow their development.
We understand less than Alzheimer's than other diseases because we have invested less time and money in the research.
The U.S. government spends 10 times more year in cancer research than Alzheimer's cancer in spite of the fact that it costs us more Alzheimer's and causes a annual number of deaths like cancer.
The lack of resources is due to a more fundamental cause, the lack of consciousness.
Because this is what people know -- but everybody else's <unk> Alzheimer's is a disease, and we can <unk>
For most of the last few years, all of the years, all of the scientists, even scientists, Alzheimer's with aging.
We think it's going to be <unk> in a normal and inevitable part of aging.
But there's only to look at a picture of a young aged healthy brain, compared to the patient of Alzheimer's patient to see the real physical damage caused by this disease.
In addition to trigger a severe memory of memory and mental skills, the harm of Alzheimer's disease reduces significantly life expectancy and is always deadly.
Remember, Dr. Alzheimer's found plates and <unk> strangers in the brain of <unk> a century ago.
For almost a century, we didn't know a lot about this.
We now know that they're made of protein molecules here.
You can think of a protein molecule like a piece of paper that it folds as origami.
There are places in the paper that are <unk>
And when it folds well, these <unk> dots end up inside.
But sometimes things go wrong, and some dots are left in the outside.
This makes the protein molecules <unk> each other, forming groups that can form large plates and <unk>
That's what we see in the brain of patients with Alzheimer's.
We've spent the last 10 years at Cambridge University trying to understand how this <unk> works.
There are many steps, and the identification of what step step is complex, as a bomb.
<unk> a wire could do anything.
<unk> others can make the bomb <unk>
You have to find the right step that we did, and then create a drug that does it.
Until recently, in his most part of the wires have reduced and expected the best.
But now there's a diverse group of people, doctors, biologists, biologists, physical <unk> physicists, engineers, and mathematicians.
And together, we've managed to identify a critical step in the process -- now it's testing a new kind of drugs that block specifically this way to stop disease.
Let me show you some of our latest results.
No one out of our lab has been seen yet.
Let's see a few videos of what happened when you test these drugs in <unk>
These are the healthy, and you can see that they move with normal.
These worms on the other hand, have a protein molecules that are thrown into each other, like humans with Alzheimer's.
And you can see that they're clearly sick.
But by giving our new drugs to these worms at an early stage, then we see that we <unk> and live a normal life.
This is just a positive initial results, but research as this shows that Alzheimer's is a disease that we can understand and cure.
After <unk> years of wait, there's real hope of what can be achieved in the next 10 or 20 years.
But to grow that hope, to beat Alzheimer's disease, we need help.
It's not about scientists like me, it's about you.
We need to make sure that Alzheimer's is a disease and that if we will, we can <unk>
In the case of other diseases, patients and their families have reported more research and <unk> pressure on governments, pharmaceutical industry on scientists and <unk>
That was essential to move forward into HIV treatment in the late 1980s.
We see that same unit today to beat cancer.
But Alzheimer's patients often can't talk about themselves.
And their families, the unconscious hidden victims of their loved ones and night, they're often too <unk> to go out and advocate for change.
So it really depends on you.
Alzheimer's is not in most cases in most cases a genetic disease.
Everyone with a brain runs the risk.
Today, there are 40 million patients like <unk> that cannot create the change they need for themselves.
<unk> talking about them, and help to demand a cure.
Thank you.
I put this article in the New York Times column in January of this year.
To fall in love with somebody, do this.
The article is about a psychological study designed to create romantic love in the lab, and from my own experience to test it at the end of the last summer.
So the procedure is quite simple: two strangers are <unk> to get 36 and more personal questions, and then they both look at the eyes without talking for four minutes.
Here's a couple questions.
Number one: If you could wake up tomorrow with one quality or skill, what would be?
Number one: When was the last time you ever get to another person?
And <unk>
<unk> that are becoming more and more personal ones.
Number one: <unk> really <unk> to your partner what you like to or her, I know very honest this time, and I gave things that you wouldn't say to someone you've just met.
When I came up with this study a few years ago, a detail really called me the attention, the gadget that two of the participants had married six months later and invited all of the lab to the <unk>
So, it was <unk> about this process of making romantic love, but of course, it was also <unk>
And when I had the opportunity to test this study, with someone who knew not particularly well, I didn't expect <unk>
And yet, we went on and --  And I thought it was a good story, so I emailed it to the neocortical column a few months later.
That was published in January, and now it's already <unk> so I guess some of you would probably ask, keep it together.
And the reason I think is this question is because I've done this question again and again in the last seven months.
And this question is just what I want to talk about today.
But let's go back to that.
A week before he was publishing the paper was very nervous.
I had been working on a romantic book in the last few years, so I was reminded of writing about my experience in romantic love in my blog.
But a blog entry can get to a few hundreds of views like a lot, and those were usually only about my Facebook friends and I imagined my article in the New York Times will probably have a thousand views.
And that looked a good burden of attention in a relatively new relationship.
But as I had no idea.
The article was published on Friday night, and now Saturday, this was in my blog.
And the Sunday, I had called the <unk> Show and Good <unk> <unk>
In one month, the paper received more than eight million pages, and I was, by saying something, little prepared for this kind of attention.
One thing is foster trust writing with each other, but another thing is to discover that the loving life of one has been international news -- and that people around the world are really interested in the state of your new relationship.
And when people called or I wrote what every day for weeks, they were always, first of the same question: still follow together?
In fact, when I was preparing this talk, I made a quick pursuit in my email with the phrase: <unk> still <unk>
And several messages came up immediately.
They were from students and journalists and strange <unk> like this.
I was interviewed on radio and <unk>
Even, I gave a talk, and a woman screamed at the stage, "Hey, <unk> where is your <unk>
And I immediately put up red.
I understand this is part of the deal.
If you write about your relationship in an international papers, you should expect people to feel comfortable asking about it.
But I was not ready for the wingspan of the answer.
The 36 questions seemed to have <unk> life.
In fact, the New York Times published a <unk> article for Saint <unk> who included the experiences of readers when they test the study in them with different degrees of success.
So my first drive to all this attention was to be very <unk> with my own relationship.
I said not to every request that we were both doing a public onset together.
<unk> TV interviews, and <unk> orders of photos of us two.
I think I was afraid to become the icons of the process of <unk> a range for which I didn't feel at all of the <unk>
And I understand that people didn't want to know only if the study works, they wanted to know if they really were able to produce love -- not just an adventure, but real love, love <unk>
But this was a question that I didn't feel able to answer me.
My relationship was just a few months ago, and I felt, most of all, that people said the wrong question.
How do you know if we were going to get it together or not, and also <unk>
If the answer was not, I would make the experience of doing these 36 questions less interesting?
Dr. Arthur <unk> wrote first about these questions in this same study in 1997. And there, the goal of researcher was not to produce romantic love.
Instead of that, I was trying to engineer interpersonal students in college students, using what <unk> called <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
Sounds romantic, right?
But the study did work.
The participants were closer after doing that. Several later studies also used <unk> protocol -- as a quick way of creating trust and interaction between strangers.
They have used it between members of the police and community, and they've used it between people in the opposite political failure.
The original version of the story, which I tested last summer, which combines personal questions with four minutes of eye contact, was cited in this paper, but unfortunately he never published.
A few months ago, I was giving a talk in a little liberal arts university, and then a student came up to me and he told me with <unk> <unk> the studio and didn't work.
He seemed <unk> for it.
And I said, "Do you want to say that you get rid of the person with the person who <unk>
Well he made a pause.
I think she just wants us to be friends.
And I said, but they became better friends?
<unk> that they did better know better after testing the <unk>
The <unk>
So, <unk> I said.
I don't think that was the answer that he was looking for.
In fact, I don't think it's the answer that none of you is looking for when it's trying to love.
I came up with the study for the first time when I was 29 and he was going through a really difficult <unk>
I had had that relationship since I had 20, which was almost all of my adult life, and he was my first real love, and he had no idea how or if I could live without him.
So I went to the science.
And I did all that I could find about romantic love, and I expected that could be a certain <unk> the heart.
I don't know if I realized this at the time I thought I just went to the book that I was writing -- but in retrospect, it seems really <unk>
I thought that if I was obsessed with the knowledge of romantic love, I would never have to feel as bad and used to feel like then.
And all this knowledge has been useful for one or another.
I'm more <unk> I'm more <unk>
I have more confidence to demand what I'm after.
But I can also see me more clearly, and I can realize that what I'm looking for is sometimes more than reasonably much than reasonably can demand me.
What I'm looking for about love is a workshop -- not only to be <unk> today and to be <unk> tomorrow, but to continue to be <unk> upon the person I love.
It may be the guarantee that people ask when they wanted to know if we were still together.
The story that the media was told about 36 questions is that there may be a short shot.
There may be a way for some ways to mitigate some of the risk <unk> and this is a very <unk> story, because in love we make us feel beautifully, but it's also frightening.
But I think when it comes to love, we're very willing to accept the short version of the story.
The version of the story that says, still follow together?
And their content with an answer of yes or No.
So more than a question question, let's say let's do more difficult questions, questions like, how do you decide who deserves your love and who not?
How are you going to stay in love with the things that are <unk> and how to figure out when to cut and <unk>
How do you live with uncertainty that inevitably leads to a relationship?
I don't necessarily know the answers to these questions, but I think they're a good beginning to have a more <unk> conversation about what to love somebody.
So, if you want the brief version of my relationship, it's <unk> a year ago, a known one, and I applied a study designed to create romantic love, we are going to get us still together, and I'm very <unk>
But fall in love is not the same thing to remain <unk>
<unk> is the easy part.
So at the end of my paper <unk> The love didn't happen.
<unk> fallen in love because we took the choice to be.
And I pointed out a little bit about the reading now, not because it's not true, but because at the moment, I hadn't considered everything that was supposed to be.
It didn't look at how many times we would have both to make that decision, and how much times I will have to keep doing that choice without knowing before if he would always choose or not.
I want it to be enough to have done and say, 36 questions, to have chosen to love someone so generous, and fun and having expressed that choice in the largest day in the United States.
But what I've done, instead is turning my relationship into the kind of myth that I don't really believe really.
And what we did, and what I may spend my life looking for is that that myth is true.
I want the happy end to implicit in the title of my paper, which is, by the way, the only part of the article that I didn't actually wrote.
But what I have in change is the opportunity to get somebody, and the hope that he also love, and it's scary but that's the deal with love.
Thank you.
I was raised by some lesbian <unk> and I had a kind of a <unk> of the forest.
New York City a time ago,  -- something that really affected me but more details later on.
I'm going to start with when I was eight years old.
I took a box of wood, and I took a bill to a dollar, a pen and a fork in her somewhere in Colorado.
And I thought some strange humanoid robot, or you would find this box about 500 years later and <unk> how our species <unk> ideas, for example how we eat the <unk>
I had no idea.
Anyway, it has grace because here I am, 30 years later, and I'm still doing boxes.
At a time I was in <unk> <unk> I like to go from school and make and <unk> and all of those things <unk> and I was doing a collage for my mother.
And I took a dictionary and I took him all the pages and I took a kind of <unk> <unk> to the style of Agnes Martin, I covered the resin and a bee <unk>
Well, my mother is afraid of bees and it's <unk> to them, so I added more resin on the canvas, thinking he could <unk>
Instead, it happened the opposite: somehow it seemed to be a way that it seemed to rise to size, as if it was that you were playing the text with a <unk>
So I did, I built more boxes.
So this time, I started to add electronic elements -- we started to add some strange electronic elements that I was finding out the street, all I could find, because I was looking for things all my life, trying to <unk> and tell stories about these objects.
So I started drawing around the objects, and I realized that my God, I can draw in space.
Can I be able to make it happen.
And I took the objects and created my own taxonomy of specimens <unk>
First of all, <unk> from those who might be able to make an idea.
Then I made a few strange things and creatures.
It was very fun to draw in the layers of <unk>
And it was great, because I started building exhibitions and those things, and I was earning some money, to bring my girlfriend to dinner, for example, going to <unk>
It was great.
At some point I became interested in the human form, sculptures of natural size in the layers.
It was great, except for one thing: <unk>
I didn't know what to do, because the resin was going to kill me.
And I was going to bed every night thinking about it.
So I tried to use glass.
I started drawing on the glass, similar to the drawing in a window, and then on a window on a window, and he had all these windows together that fit a three-dimensional composition of it.
And this really worked, and so I could stop using the <unk>
So I did this for years, and my work <unk> with something very big, I call <unk>
For <unk> inspired me, inspired by the <unk> of <unk> <unk> <unk> which is a painting at the Museum of <unk> in Spain.
Do you know?
Well, it's a fantastic picture.
They say it's a little bit ahead of your time.
Well, <unk> <unk> this piece.
It weighs 11,000 pounds.
5.5 feet long.
It has <unk> so it's 10 feet of composition.
It's a little bit weird.
Well, that's the source of blood.
On the left, it's Jesus and <unk>
There's a cave where all of these creatures with animal heads travel between two worlds.
They go from the world of representation, to this <unk> mesh of <unk> where it <unk>
This is where the creatures with animals with animals are headed to <unk> lists for suicide in the ocean.
The ocean is comprised of thousands of elements.
This is one god <unk> tied to a <unk>
So Billy Graham is in the <unk> The <unk> -- the <unk> platform of the <unk> <unk> the shelter of Osama Bin Laden, there are all sorts of rare things that can be found if you look very well in the ocean.
Anyway, also kind of a <unk>
It's coming out of the ocean, and it spits out oil in a hand while the other hand comes out.
Their hands are like <unk> and it seems like a <unk> that holds the Earth and the cosmos in balance.
So it's one aspect of the <unk>
It's a little bit a story.
That is the hand that I <unk>
And then, when you go to the other side, it has a <unk> like a bird <unk> and it spits out these <unk>
It also has a <unk> 5.5 feet long that binds to the <unk>
But anyway, the tail goes fire to the <unk> on a <unk>
I don't know why it happened.
Things that go around, you know.
His tail ends up in a <unk> <unk> balloon.
Have you <unk>
They did in the 1980s, as if they were baseball cards of terrorists.
Very <unk> for your time.  This brings me to my last project.
I'm in the middle of two <unk> One is called <unk>
This is a six year-old project to make 100 of these human beings.
Each one is a archive of our culture, through media and material and material are <unk> dictionaries or magazines.
But each one acts as a kind of archive in a form of human being, and they travel in groups of 20, four or 12 at the time.
They're like cells, they come together, <unk>
And you can walk in between them. I'm getting years.
Each one is basically a microscope <unk> which weighs 1.3 pounds of a human trapped in its inside.
This is a little cave in the chest.
That's the <unk> it's the chest, you can get the entrance to it.
I'm going to come up with the rest of the body -- there's a waterfall that comes out of the chest, and you cover the penis or <unk> or whatever it is, you have, a kind of <unk> thing.
This is a quick review of these works because I can't afford it for a long time.
We have layers, you can see.
This is a body in half.
This is two heads, and it's communicating between the two.
There are some pills that go out and go into the head of this <unk>
There's a little forest scene inside the <unk> <unk>
Can you <unk>
Anyway, this talk is about these <unk> just like the boxes that we live in.
We're in a box, the solar system is a box.
This brings me to my last box.
It's a brick box. It's called <unk> <unk>
Within this box there is a physicist, a neuroscientist, a musician, a musician, a musician, a writer, a <unk> an editorial arm that spreads all the content that we do in the world, and a garden.
It <unk> the box and all of the people in the size of each other as particles.
And I think that's the way to change the world.
When you <unk> who is and the box that you're living on.
And together we came to realize that we're all together in this, that this illusion that we are different, these concepts of countries, from the borders, of religion doesn't work.
We're all very made of the same matter and in the same box.
And if we don't start sharing those things with sweetness and <unk> we're all going to die very soon.
Thank you very much.
What do you do when you hurt your head?
They take a <unk>
But for this pill to get against pain, first of the stomach, the guts and other organs.
So I'm going to take a pill the most effective system that is the most effective and <unk> system so that any drug is effect on your body.
<unk> though, is that the <unk> any drug is <unk>
And this is a big problem, especially in HIV patients.
When they take <unk> drugs, these are <unk> to decrease the amount of viruses in the blood, and increase the heart of cells.
But they are also known by their side effects <unk> in the vast majority of negative, because in the time that it takes to get to the current stream -- it will be <unk> and worse than it takes to its destination, which is where it's more important, in the HIV facility.
These are regions of the body like the <unk> <unk> the nervous system, the lungs, where the virus is <unk> and it doesn't get easily in the blood flow of the patients that are <unk> to the regular therapy with antiretroviral drugs.
However, after the disruption of treatment, the virus can wake up and infect new stem cells.
This is the great problem of HIV treatment with the current drugs that are a lifetime treatment for life run by the oral <unk>
One day, I sat down, and I thought, "You know, making the treatment right directly to the virus, without the <unk> risk of <unk>
As a scientific scientist in <unk> the answer was in front of me: <unk> of course.
If you use it in <unk> for <unk> and surgery surgery -- they can be used for anything else -- including transportation <unk> of drugs.
In fact, we're already using pulses of laser to open up or drill extremely small holes, that open and closing almost immediately the cells infected with HIV to introduce drugs.
The best people ask, "How is that <unk>
We sent a small and powerful laser ray over the cell membrane infected by HIV while these cells are embedded in a liquid that contains the drug.
The laser goes through the cell, while the cell absorbs the drug in a matter of learners.
Before you even realize, the hole is <unk> immediately.
We're testing this technology in vitro <unk> or <unk> but the goal is to bring this technology to the human body, apply it to the human body.
"How is that <unk> <unk>
Well, the answer is, through a <unk> device.
With the first head, which is our laser, we're going to do a <unk> on the site of the infection.
The second head, which is a camera, is going to the site of the infection.
Finally, the third head, a <unk> which distributes the drug, it releases directly into the site of infection, as the laser is used again to keep the cells open.
Well, this doesn't seem a lot of time.
But one day, if it's successful, this technology can lead to eradication of HIV in the body.
Yeah. One cure for HIV.
This is the dream of every researcher of <unk> in our case, a <unk>
Thank you.
In the last decade, I've looked at armed groups and armed organizations like terrorists, insurgents or <unk>
<unk> what these groups do when they're not <unk>
My goal is to understand better to these agents of violence generators and study ways to encourage the transition from violent participation to violent confrontation not violent.
I do work work in the world of politics and the library.
Understanding these groups is key to solving almost every conflict in course, because the war has changed.
It used to be a dispute between states.
Not anymore.
It's now a conflict between states and non-state actors.
For example, of <unk> peace deals with 1975 and 2011, <unk> were signed up between a state and a non-governmental actor.
So we need to understand these <unk> we have even <unk> or <unk> in any process of successful conflicts.
But how do you do that?
We need to know what motivates these organizations.
We know very well the reasons why they do it, but no one is looking at what they do when they didn't go back.
The armed struggle and the armed policies are <unk>
It's all part of the same organization.
We can't understand these groups, not much less <unk> without a global view.
The armed groups today are complex organizations.
For example, the <unk> <unk> known for their violent <unk> against Israel.
Since its creation in the 1980s, <unk> has also established a political party -- a network of social services and a military device.
In the same way, Palestinian Palestinian known for their suicide attacks against Israel, also runs the <unk> of Gaza from 2007.
So these groups make more than just to fire.
They're multitasking
They had a complex machinery of communication stations radio stations TV stations, Internet websites and strategies in social networks.
And here you have the printed magazine magazine in English and published to <unk>
The armed groups also invest in a complex fundraising <unk> but through business <unk> for example, building companies.
These activities are key.
They allow these groups to increase their strength, increase their funding, to recruit their brand.
The armed groups also do something else: create stronger ties with their population investing in social services.
They build schools, run hospitals, they put professional training programs or <unk>
<unk> offers all these services and more.
The armed groups are also trying to conquer the population by offering something that the state doesn't make security and protection.
The rise of the Taliban in an Afghanistan torn through the war or even the beginning of the ascent of <unk> can also be able to figure out how to look at the efforts of these groups for giving safety.
Unfortunately, in these cases, security has a price inspired by the population.
But in general, provide social services means filling up a vacuum, a <unk> gap by the government, and it allows these groups to strengthen and increase their power.
For example, the election victory of 2006 for Palestinian Hamas cannot be able to recognize the social work of the group.
It's a really complex stage, even in the West, when we look at groups <unk> we only think about the violent side.
But that's not enough to understand the strengths of these groups, the strategy or long-term vision.
These groups are <unk>
<unk> because they fill up <unk> gaps by the government, and they emerge as armed groups and political groups, participate in nonviolent struggle and give governance.
And the more complex and sophisticated ones are these organizations, we can be <unk> as something unlike a state.
How would you call a group like <unk>
<unk> part of an territory, run all of their <unk> they collect the trash, they run the <unk> system.
It's a state? It's a <unk> group.
Or maybe it's something else, something new and different.
And what is <unk>
The lines are <unk>
We live in a world of states, from nations without state and hybrids and the weakest the states are states, like in the Middle East, more <unk> and they fill that gap and non-governmental actors.
This is important for governments, because to counter these groups will have to invest more in no military tools.
<unk> that government has to be in the center of any sustainable approach.
This is very important to establish and put the peace.
If we understand better groups that we will understand better how to offer to encourage the transition from violence to violence.
In this new dispute between states and actors, actors, the military power can win some <unk> but not to give peace or stability.
In order to get these goals we need long-term investments to fill in that safety void to fill that vacuum vacuum that allowed these groups to thrive in a principle.
Thank you.
I'm a <unk> as a woman and as a feminist.
My opinions about gender equality is <unk> but I'm afraid to accept openly the label of <unk> it would be unfair for the <unk>
I'm a feminist, but pretty bad.
And so I would think of it as a bad feminist thing.
Or, at least, I wrote a paper, and a book called "The <unk> and then on interviews, people started to call me the <unk> <unk>
So what started as a personal joke meant to myself and a <unk> <unk> has become a bigger thing.
Let me give you a step back.
When I was a young man, especially in my youth and the 20 years, I had strange ideas about the <unk> these women <unk> <unk> with men and <unk> for sex. Like if that was a bad thing.
Today, I see how women are treated all around the world and anger, in particular, it looks like a perfectly reasonable answer.
But at that time, I was worried about the tone that I was using the people in the <unk> that could be a feminist point.
Being labeled a feminist was a <unk> a taboo word <unk>
I would tell myself as a woman who doesn't follow the rules, which is trying to believe that with high self-esteem and <unk> to believe it's equal or top of a man.
No one wants to be that woman <unk> until it realizes that it's actually that woman and you can't imagine being another person.
Over time, as I grew up, I started to accept that I am, in fact, feminist, and also proud to be.
For me, certain claims are <unk> women are equal to men.
They were doing the same good at the same work.
We have a right to travel around the world as we call it free or violence.
We have a right to use an easy way and accessible the contraceptives and services.
We have the right to decide about our bodies, without the need for <unk> or doctrines of <unk>
We have the right to respect.
There's more.
When you talk about the needs of women, you have to have to account our other <unk>
We are not only women.
We are people with a different body, expression of gender, religion and <unk> social condition and much more.
We need to realize these differences and how we behave in the same way that we have in common.
Without this kind of <unk> our feminism is nothing.
For me, these truths are <unk> but to be clear: I'm a mess.
I'm full of contradictions.
There's a lot of things that make me a bad feminist thing.
I have another confession.
When I go to work, I hear rap music -- all volume.
Although the letter degrades women and offends me, the classic <unk> <unk> of Yin yang are amazing.
<unk> reality with your <unk> <unk>
<unk> <unk> <unk> until you give you the <unk>
Think about it.
<unk> poetry, right?
I'm completely <unk> by my musical needs.
I firmly believe in the work of man, which is all I don't want to do, <unk> -- all the tasks -- but also killing insects, the <unk> of garbage and <unk> and maintenance <unk>
I don't want to have anything to do with that.
<unk> my favorite color.
<unk> from fashion journals.
I can see "The <unk> and the <unk> <unk> and I have erotic fantasies of <unk> stories that make reality.
Some of my crimes are more <unk>
If a woman wants to adopt the name of her husband, it's his choice, and I'm not who for <unk>
If a woman decides to stay home to raise their children, I don't feel that choice, too.
The problem is not that it becomes economically vulnerable through this same choice, the problem is that our society is <unk> so that it makes women economically vulnerable when they <unk>
This is a problem.
<unk> the conventional feminism has ignored or <unk> historically the needs of women of color, the gay <unk> and <unk> for women white, <unk> and high <unk>
Listen, if that's good feminism is a very bad feminist box.
It also happens, as a feminist, I feel a lot of pressure.
We have this trend of <unk> <unk> in a <unk>
We hope that we are going to do it forever.
When we get rid of the <unk> with a lot of taste from the same <unk> where they <unk>
As I said, I'm a <unk> I already consider to be <unk> from that <unk> before I try put myself there.
<unk> women, particularly innovative and the leaders of the sector, have fear of being tagged as <unk>
They are afraid to stand up and say, "Yes, I'm <unk> for fear of what it means is that <unk> fear doesn't be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to
Let's take <unk> or like I call it, the <unk>
In the last few years it's a feminist feminist issue.
In the <unk> Music <unk> in 2014, <unk> in front of the word <unk> three feet tall.
It was a <unk> show -- see this star of poop embrace openly feminism and to know women and young men to be feminist is something to be proud of.
So <unk> the cultural critics began the endless debates if they were to <unk> it was or not precisely feminist.
It was going to be their feminism, instead of simply believing the word of an adult woman and <unk>
They were able to make sure that we're still fighting because we're still fighting for a lot, we want a lot, we need a lot of <unk>
We're going far beyond the sensible criticism and <unk> to <unk> the feminism of any wife, <unk> until it's not left.
We don't need to do that.
The bad feminism, or rather, one feminism is the point of <unk>
But what happens next?
We went from recognizing our <unk> to the day, going to the action and be a little <unk>
If I hear <unk> music, I'm creating a demand for artists that would be more happy to provide a free supply supply.
These artists will not change their way of talking about women in their songs until they improve change effectively affecting their profit.
It's certainly hard.
Why does their music have to be so <unk>
It's hard to choose something better and so easy to justify a worse choice.
But when the bad decisions make that it makes it harder for women to achieve equality, equality that we all deserve and is our responsibility.
I think of my <unk> three and four years.
They are two <unk> <unk> and bright and very brave. I want you to grow in a world.
And where they are <unk> by the strong creatures they are.
And I think of them, all of a sudden, the best option will be <unk> as something much easier to do.
We can all make better decisions.
We can change the channel when a television program is treating sex violence against women as a sport, <unk> the Game of <unk>
We can change the radio station when we hear songs that treat women as nothing.
We can spend our money to go to the film in another part when movies aren't treating women rather than as objects as objects.
We can stop supporting professional sports where athletes treat their peers as <unk>
In any case, men, especially white men can say, "No, I'm not going to post in his magazine, participating in his project, or working with you, until it doesn't include a number of women, so much to participate as to make decisions.
I'm not going to work with you until your desk or the organization is more <unk> with a wider range of people."
Those of us who are <unk> but we're going to engage engaging in this kind of projects, we can also force them to be even more like us until more like us are forcing them to overcome barriers to decision jobs.
Because we are not <unk> without these efforts, without taking these <unk> our achievements are going to mean very little.
We can make these little acts of bravery and hope that our decisions will come to the top, to the people in the power principals and <unk> music, <unk> the <unk> the people that can make great decisions, more courageous, to create lasting change.
We can also say with bravery our feminism, good, bad, or any <unk>
The last line of my book, <unk> <unk> says, <unk> will be a bad feminist to not be in <unk>
This is true because of many reasons, but I say, about everything, because <unk> my voice was <unk> and feminism helped me <unk>
There was one incident.
I call it the incident to deal with what happened.
A few kids were scared when I was very young, and I didn't know that kids can do this to a girl.
They were treated like anything.
I started to believe it was nothing.
I was able to get my voice, and after all of you didn't believe myself that I could say something that might matter.
But I was writing.
And I went back to <unk>
I became a stronger version of myself.
And the words of those women who could understand a story like mine, and the women who looked like me and understood what meant to live in this world if you have a brown skin.
I read the words of women who showed me that it was nothing.
I learned to write like this, and then I learned to write like myself.
I found my voice again, and I started to believe that my voice is powerful beyond what you can measure.
Through the writing and feminism, too, I also discovered that if I was a little brave one, another woman could hear me and see that none of us is anything that the world tries to tell us we are.
In one hand, I have the power to accomplish anything.
And in the other, I have a <unk> reality that I'm just a woman.
I'm a bad feminist, a good woman, I'm a good woman, and I'm trying to improve my thinking to think, and what I do, and what I do, without leaving everything that makes me human.
I hope we can all do the same thing.
I hope that we can all be a little courageous, when you need to be a little bit of <unk>
Right after Christmas last year, <unk> children in California, had <unk> for having gone down to be exposed to someone who had been there.
The virus then went through the border with Canada, <unk> over 100 children in <unk>
One of the <unk> things on this outbreak is that the <unk> that can be a lousy child for a child with a immune system -- is one of the most easily diseases in the world.
There's an effective vaccine against this for more than half a century -- but many of the children involved in the <unk> outbreak had not been vaccinated because their parents were afraid of something supposed to be still <unk>
But a moment, it was not the article that unleashed employers about autism and the <unk> vaccines, untouched and marked by being a <unk> fraud by the British Medical <unk>
It doesn't create most intelligent scientists that the theory that vaccines cause autism is a <unk>
I think most of you know it, but millions of parents around the world are still <unk> that vaccines will put in danger to their children of having autism.
Why?
Here's why.
This is a graph of the estimates of autism growth in time.
For most of the 20th century, autism was considered a very rare disease.
The few psychologists and pediatricians who had heard of it creating to develop all his professional life without seeing one case.
For decades, the prevalence estimates kept stable only three or four children per <unk>
But then, in the 1990s, the numbers started to <unk>
It's a hedge fund Fund as <unk> <unk> <unk> by routinely shared autism as an epidemic as if I could get another child in <unk>
What's going on?
If you're not vaccines, what is it?
If you ask people from the Center for Disease Control in Atlanta -- what's going on, they tend to based on phrases like <unk> diagnostic <unk> and "A better <unk> to explain these figures <unk>
But that kind of language doesn't <unk> a lot of the fears of a young mother who looks for in the face of his son of two years, the visual eye.
If the criteria of diagnosis, they had to figure out why they were so <unk> at the beginning?
Why were the cases of autism so difficult to find before the decade <unk>
Five years ago, I decided to figure out the answers to these questions.
I learned that what happened is what happened to do with slow progress and <unk> of science that the power of storytelling.
For most of the 20th century, doctors talked about a story about what autism is and the autism has discovered, but that story turned out to be fake, and the consequences of the same are having a devastating impact on global public health.
There was a second more accurate history of autism that had lost and forgotten in the dark corners of the clinical literature.
This second story tells us all about how we got here and where we need to go.
The first story begins with a child angels, Leo <unk> at Johns Hopkins <unk> in <unk> <unk> published an article that describes 11 young patients who looked like <unk> private, <unk> people around their own, even their own parents.
They could have fun for hours by waving their hands in front of their faces, but they were <unk> of panic by <unk> as when you didn't put your favorite toy in their usual location without knowing them.
On the basis of patients treated in their clinic, <unk> <unk> that autism is very weird.
For the 1950s, as the main authority of the world in the subject, he declared seen less than 150 real cases of his syndrome while <unk> references from places as far as South Africa.
This is actually not surprisingly, because the criteria of <unk> for autism diagnosis were very <unk>
For example, <unk> giving that diagnosis to children with <unk> but now we know that epilepsy is very common in autism.
He was once <unk> that he had become nine of every 10 children sent by other doctors to her office to be autistic without giving them a diagnosis of autism.
<unk> was a smart man, but part of his theories were not <unk>
<unk> autism as a form of diabetes is caused by cold, cold parents.
These kids, he said, they've kept it carefully in a refrigerator that doesn't make it <unk>
At the same time, though, I noticed that some of her young patients had special skills that cluster in certain areas like music, mathematics and memory.
One of the children in their clinic could distinguish between 18 <unk> before I get the two years.
When his mother put one of his favorite records, he correctly said, <unk>
But <unk> had a bad opinion of these skills, saying things like the children were just <unk> what they had heard of their parents <unk> desperate to win their approval.
As a result, autism became a source of shame for families, and two generations of autistic children were sent to institutions for their own well, becoming invisible to the world in general.
Amazingly, it wasn't until the decade of 1970 and researchers started testing the <unk> theory that autism was weird.
<unk> <unk> a cognitive psychologist in London, thought that the theory of <unk> mothers -- was pretty stupid.
She and her husband John were warm and <unk> and they had a deep autistic daughter called <unk>
<unk> and John knew how hard it was to raise a girl as a service of support, no special education, and no access to other resources without a diagnosis.
To defend the National National Service, they needed more resources for autistic children and their families, <unk> and their colleague named Judith Gould decided to do something that would have done 30 years before.
They launched a study of prevalence prevalence in the general population.
It was a suburb of London called <unk> to try to find the autistic children in the community.
What you saw was that the model of <unk> was too limited, because the reality of autism was much more <unk> and diverse in diverse life.
Some children couldn't talk at all, while others were being tested in their fascination with astrophysics, in dinosaurs or in the <unk> of the <unk>
In another way, these children didn't fit in beautiful frames and <unk> as he said, and they saw a lot of them, much more than the <unk> model, would have predicted.
At first, they were lost by trying to make sense of their data.
How did nobody ever realize these kids before?
But then <unk> found a reference to a paper that was published in German in <unk> the next year to the <unk> item and then <unk> buried under the cinders of a terrible time that nobody wanted to remember.
<unk> I knew about this article of competition, but it avoided <unk> in his own work.
There was no even one translation in the English -- but luckily, the husband of <unk> speak German, and he <unk> it for her.
The document offers an alternative story of autism.
His author was a man named Hans <unk> who ran a clinical clinic with a school in Vienna, in the 1930s.
The ideas of Asperger's for children with a little bit of learning differences were <unk> even for contemporary standards.
The morning in their clinic started with music, and the kids kept their games at the afternoon.
Instead of blaming the parents of causing autism, Asperger's described as <unk> disability by life that required forms of support and <unk> spaces for the course of all life.
Instead of treating kids in their clinic as patients, Asperger's called their little teachers, and he was going to help in the development of education methods that were especially right for them.
<unk> saw autism as a diverse diverse and a diverse variety of gifts, and disability.
He believed that autism and autistic traits were common and they have always been, seeing aspects of this continuous <unk> known in <unk> like the awkward social scientist and Professor <unk>
He was beyond even until I say that for success in science and art, a little bit of autism is essential.
<unk> and Judith found that <unk> was wrong with that autism was <unk> as well as the parents were the <unk>
Over the next few years, they worked silently with the American American Association -- to extend the criteria of diagnostic that reflect the diversity of what they called <unk> <unk>
At the end of the '80s and the early '90s, their changes came into <unk> by using the limited model of <unk> by a broad and inclusive.
These changes didn't go into a broken <unk>
<unk> when <unk> and Judith worked on each other, to reform these <unk> people around the world see an autistic adult for the first time.
Before I come out <unk> <unk> in 1988, just a small circle, <unk> by experts knew what the autism, but after the <unk> performance of <unk> <unk> as <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk> with four awards of <unk> <unk> psychologists, teachers and fathers around the world knew what the autism was.
At the same time, those first clinical trials were introduced to use to diagnose autism.
And no longer had to have a connection with that little circle of experts to get a diagnosis for his son.
The combination of <unk> <unk> the changes in the criteria and the introduction of these tests created a network, a perfect storm of consciousness of autism.
The number of diagnostics started <unk> just like they predicted <unk> and <unk> in fact they were hoping that it was, getting people with autism and their families finally <unk> support and services that are <unk>
So Andrew <unk> came to blame the vaccines for the increase in the diagnostics. A very powerful and <unk> history as bad as the <unk> theory that autism was <unk>
If the current estimate of the prevention center that one of every 68 children in America are in the spectrum, it's right, the autistic are one of the world's largest largest groups in the world.
In the last few years, the autistic people have joined the Internet to reject the idea that they are the puzzles for solving the new medical breakthroughs -- <unk> the term <unk> to celebrate the varieties of human cognition.
A way to understand <unk> is to think in terms of human operating systems.
The fact that a PC doesn't work with Windows doesn't mean it's <unk>
According to the <unk> standards, the normal human brain is easily <unk> social <unk> and suffer from attention attention to detail.
Indeed, autistic people have a hard time to live in a world not built for them.
70 years later, we're still reaching <unk> which believed that the <unk> for the most <unk> aspects of autism are found in the understanding of teachers, employers with capacity, communities of support, and the parents with faith in the potential of their children.
An autistic woman called <unk> <unk> once said, "We need all the hands on cover to <unk> the ship of the <unk>
As we move towards an uncertain future, we need all the forms of human intelligence on the planet to address the challenges that we face as a society.
We cannot afford to lose a brain.
Thank you.
